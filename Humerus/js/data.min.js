And the real issues had to do with kind of a historical way of approaching this, and also patients&#039; perspectives.  Today, patients have a much, much different perspective of outcome.  Patients who are older, if they&#039;re retired or not, might be thinking about playing tennis or golf, or doing overhand &ndash; overhead activities.

And the concept of surgical treatment of these was always an issue about fixation in the bone.  Just as in the distal radius, there was really no implant that was anatomically shaped.  So, we used to put plates that, primarily were used for the proximal tibia up in the humerus, and kind of wondered why we ran into trouble with the fixation.  So, because of that, because there wasn&#039;t really predictable ways of treating, there was a continuation of this idea that perhaps the patient is better off with nonsurgical treatment.  I suspect that there are a lot of patients who were better off, given the fact that, if you look at the data that have been generated, not by my partner here but by many, there are a fair amount of complications from the operative treatment, as it&#039;s become kind of the standard of care, almost. So, what we learned along the way is, the problem of the bone has been somewhat overcome and the problem of the patient expectations have changed, to understand that we&#039;re more sensitive to people&#039;s needs.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1450A/M1450A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"Current and Historical Perspectives on the Proxima",title:"Patient Expectations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1450A/M1450A_04",script:"<p><b>Dr. Jupiter:</b></p><p>Today, if you showed someone my age, who&#039;s active, the x-ray, and there was some deformity, displacement, or whatever, they would expect you to be reducing it anatomically.  So patients are driving this now, by a different perspective than existed for quite a long time.  And that, probably, is as much a reason why there&#039;s so much surgery.  You know, if you give surgeons an indication, they take it.  And just like the nailing of the humerus, really there&#039;s no evidence that it really has made a huge difference in prospective randomized studies.  And people started to do nailing of proximal humerus fractures that were nondisplaced, and creating rotator cuff problems or whatever.

Any discussion of where proximal humerus fracture treatment is today really warrants discussion of locked plating.  So, locked plating was introduced many, many years ago, but really kind of mainstream maybe about a decade ago.  And like many other areas of orthopaedics, this was really introduced by manufacturers, without clinical evidence that these were advantageous at all; even though biomechanically, it made sense.  Of all the areas of the body for potential applications of locked plates, there weren&#039;t many other areas where it made more sense, and we were having more problems with conventional implants, than the proximal humerus.  So, all of a sudden the switch flipped, and locked plates were put on every proximal humerus fracture. And it turns out, and again kind of in a backwards way, we found out that locked plates actually are not a panacea for proximal humerus fractures.  And, we&#039;re finding out maybe a little bit slower in other areas of the body, there are technical factors, particularly with fracture reduction, that really determine the outcome and the maintenance of reduction for that fracture.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1450A/M1450A_05.jpg",vidndx:"4"},{category:"Current and Historical Perspectives on the Proxima",title:"Technical Aspects of Locked Plates",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1450A/M1450A_06",script:"<p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>Certainly locked plates have revolutionized the way we treat some fractures, and proximal humerus fractures as well.

So, I think one critical factor is using some sort of suture in the rotator cuff, and some sort of soft-tissue augmentation, to really try to counteract the varus displacing forces of the rotator cuff, and really try to bypass the force that&#039;s on the tips of those locked screws in the humeral head.  So, certainly using some soft-tissue repair has potential &ndash; and again, none of these have yet been shown &ndash; in high quality studies &ndash; to really impact outcomes, yet, but these are things that are kind of slow coming out at meetings like this.

So, just another factor, and there are some some of my colleagues who are kind of forward thinkers, have started placing endosteal plates and using fibular allograft as a potential reconstruction of the kind of medial column, or the calcar.

Alternatively, with the varus collapse of the humeral head, typically the weak point is at the tip of the locked screw.

So, maybe we&#039;ll start it off with just a clinical scenario, and Ken, I&#039;ll just give you a case presentation: 56-year-old man comes in, high-energy injury, rolled over his dirt bike.  Closed injury.  Neurologically intact, and he presents with a displaced three-part proximal humerus fracture.  How are you going to approach that in terms of the thought process, a workup?  What studies are you going to want to assess it?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Shoulder CT</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>Well, for that kind of fellow, after the initial trauma assessment, assuming there&#039;s no other orthopedic injuries or anything else that would be more acute, I would CT his shoulder, in addition to getting clean films, and based on what you described, it sounds like it would be mostly an operative situation for me.</p><p><i><font size="-2">CT Information</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>What kinds of things are you looking for on your CT scan as far as decision making in terms of how you&#039;re going to approach that fracture?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Fracture and/or Dislocation?</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>I&#039;m looking at the number of parts.  I&#039;m looking at making sure there&#039;s no dislocation, trying to get an idea, not so much of how difficult it will be to fix it, but also to tell the patient a bit of prognostic expectations.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Plane Film Limitations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>I agree with Ken.  I think a CT scan certainly is something that I often have a low threshold for getting the plane films or often difficulty getting good views because the patients are acutely injured, and it&#039;s painful to get an axillary lateral, and you really have a difficult time getting a good understanding of the fracture pattern with plane film sometimes.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Fracture Complexity</font></i></p><p>So, I recommend a CT scan.  Looking for a head splitting component which is hard to really decipher from your plane x-rays at times, and also, I&#039;ve had situations where there&#039;s a glenoid fracture and some of these fracture dislocations of the proximal humerus is helpful in that regard too.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Head Viability</font></i></p><p>Also, it gives you some information on the vitality of the head fragment, how big or how large is that medial metaphyseal extension, giving you an idea of the viability of the actual head.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Head Vascularity</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I think that&#039;s a really key point.  Head vascularity I think is something that we may not pay enough attention to, but Dr. Hertell&#039;s done a lot of work on this looking at the length of the medial metaphyseal extension and the displacement of the medial periosteal hinge with regard to head vascularity.  And those two points correlate more with head vascularity than the original classification systems looking at angulation and displacement, so I think the CT scan can really give you a good understanding of those two issues and how they may affect head vascularity.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Avascular Head</font></i></p><p>In a situation, Alex, if you have a 56-year-old guy, and let&#039;s just say that his medial metaphyseal extension is 2.0 millimeters, which is next to nothing, and it&#039;s fairly widely displaced, so you&#039;re pretty certain that this guy&#039;s head is going to be avascular given the fracture pattern.  Is that going to change the way you approach the treatment of it in a guy who&#039;s 56?</p><p><i><font size="-2">AVN Issue</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>Well, a 56-year-old who went over on a dirt bike is probably somebody who&#039;s pretty active and probably somebody who I&#039;d lean towards operative fixation and trying to reconstruct the shoulder with what he has.  If the vascularity is, indeed, compromised to a degree that the shoulder will go on to a non-union &ndash; to, rather, AVN, that&#039;s something that could be addressed with a later surgery.  And oftentimes, the AVNs are often asymptomatic in the shoulder of being a non-weight-bearing joint primarily.  However, I would certainly monitor someone like that closely for the development of an AVN down the line, perhaps with an MRI and obviously clinical examinations.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Tuberosity Relationship</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I think I definitely agree with that.  I think AVN in the shoulder generally is well tolerated.  It sometimes takes four to five years if they&#039;re going to go on to develop any sort of collapse, and if you can restore the relationship of the tuberosities to the head and the head tuberosity complex to the shaft, I think, like Alex said, you&#039;re going to have a lot more options later on down the line as far as arthroplasty is concerned, but you may have an excellent outcome that lasts for a long time, just with the initial fixation.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_01.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Proximal Humerus Fractures",title:"Technical Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_02",script:'<p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>So, let&#039;s go on and talk about some of the technical aspects in terms of fixing proximal humerus fractures.  Ken, do you have any pearls on how you approach these in terms of surgical approach, deltopectoral versus a lateral approach?<p><i><font size="-2">Surgical Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>I usually pretty much all the time these days do a deltopectoral exposure, but I tend to cheat a bit more lateral than the traditional description.  Particularly folks who have a very heavy deltoid, the young people mostly.  It&#039;s different when you&#039;re treating more geriatric patients, and I go as distal as I have to, to be able to have a good exposure and get all the pieces out and get a good idea of the shoulder image of what I&#039;m trying to fix.</p><p><i><font size="-2">More Lateral</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>Is the reason you treat more lateral is to avoid injury to the vascular structures to the humeral head, or is that more for exposure?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Axillary Nerve Concerns</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>It&#039;s more for exposure.  It&#039;s more for exposure in folks who have a very bulky deltoid and also puts a bit less tension on your deltoid.  I guess a little less chance of damaging your axillary nerve as it comes on the deltoid.</p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>To follow up on what you said, I think I have to agree that one of the things I have to remember when I get into the shoulder with a many-part fracture, three or four-part proximal humerus fracture is to resist temptation to strip the fragments off their soft tissue attachments for better visualization and piecing them together.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Control and Mobilize</font></i></p><p>But instead do exactly what you said is get them mobilized and get them controlled with suture fixation of the rotator cuff attachments, and I think that&#039;s a nice way to hold reduction and to visualize reduction.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Soft Tissue Attachments</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I think one of the great points that you guys brought up is, Alex, what you mentioned.  The soft tissue attachments to these tuberosity pieces I think are critical.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Cuff and Capsule</font></i></p><p>And I think a lot of the blood supply comes around that posterior circumflex vessel, which heads medially and sort of wraps around the back, and these are not like arthroplasty cases or massive cuff-tear cases where you have to do aggressive mobilization of soft tissues to restore function and motion.  These are people that had pretty normal shoulders going into it, and in terms of their cuff and their capsule a lot of that stuff is usually intact.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Patient Position</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>Which brings up a point.  How many of you do it flat, and how many use a beach chair position for the fractures?</p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>If I know it&#039;s something I&#039;m going to fix, I&#039;ll oftentimes just do it flat with a sandbag underneath the shoulder to bolster them up.  If I&#039;m on the fence or I know it&#039;s going to be arthroplasty, I&#039;ll do them in a modified beach chair with the Cerebella headrest and the arm over the table.</p><p><i><font size="-2">C-Arm Position</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>I use a standard operating room table, modified beach chair, but the back is only up about 45 degrees, and turn the bed to where the C-arm can be brought in from the head, and just like you mentioned.  You make a really good point.  Really make sure that you can get a good AP and lateral of the entire head before you prep and drape the patient because you won&#039;t be able to do that once you&#039;ve got the patient draped out.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Beach Chair</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>I agree.  Usually for the isolated geriatric fracture we&#039;ll use the beach chair just because of that, because you can convert it to an arthroplasty.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Jackson Table</font></i></p><p>For the multi-trauma patient that happens to have a proximal humerus fracture, we&#039;ll just do all the injuries in a flat Jackson.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Implant Issues</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>How about some of the &ndash;  in terms of technical issues with, let&#039;s just say a pre-contoured plate for treatment of a three-part fracture with a greater tuberosity, head segment, shaft segment, lesser still attached to the head.  What are some of the technical issues in terms of how you can go wrong with that?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Deltopectoral Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>I think the biggest technical issue is that I use the deltopectoral approach, which basically is 90 degrees from the application of the plate, you&#039;re placing the plate directly lateral, and you have, as we&#039;ve mentioned, the deltoid is in the way, and you need to &ndash; don&#039;t detach the deltoid from its proximal attachment.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Minimally Invasive Reduction</font></i></p><p>And I just make every effort to as minimalistically get my reduction with the suture fixation and the bone tendon junction of the rotator cuff.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Internal Rotation</font></i></p><p>And then with the arm in neutral position, get a reduction and elevate my head as minimalistically as I can and use some K-wires to preliminarily stabilize the whole fracture, because you kind of have to rotate the arm in some to get the plate laterally and to get any kind of preliminary K-wires screwed into the plate.  That internal rotation is going to go against your reduction.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Plate Position</font></i></p><p>So, I usually add a few 2.0 K-wires from the shaft up into the head, just to kind of give it some initial stability so I can do a little internal rotation.  And that helps get that plate directly lateral posterior to the bicep screw.  The biggest struggle is that you&#039;re applying a plate directly lateral, where your approach is directly anterior.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Bone Graft</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriquez:</b></p><p>Do you use bone graft a lot?  Do you bone graft easily?  With what?  With chips, or what do you use for your geriatric heads?</p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>For me it&#039;s usually cancellous croutons, something osteoconductive, and you make a good point that the proximal humerus is really a void of any structural support, and when you go to elevate that head up and you&#039;ve put an osteotome in the area, then you&#039;ve got this big hole.  I think you kind of have to put something there.  Do most of you guys bone graft with some type of osteoconductive source?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Bone Graft Substitutes</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>Sometimes I&#039;ll use one of these ones that kind of hardens as you mix it, so you put it in there and gives you a little bit structural stability.  </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_03.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"Proximal Humerus Fractures",title:"Tips and Pearls",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_01",script:'<p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>Any preferences for you gentlemen to take the vein?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Vein Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I usually take the vein laterally and I really don&#039;t do a lot of vein exposure, which is something I learned from Dr. Hertell, and if you watch his approach, he starts very proximal up by the clavicle, and he starts working medially and basically just peeling the pectoralis muscle fibers off the fat stripe, and if you do that, you almost don&#039;t have to expose the vein from the fat stripe, but you can just peel the pec fibers off of that fat stripe and the vein will go with it.  You can get the venus tributaries to the pec as you go, and it&#039;s actually a nice technique in terms of preserving the vein, because as we know, that vein oftentimes can get bagged during your approach and your exposure.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Taking the Vein</font></i></p><p>I think you can take the vein either way.

I just take that lateral, but I go for the biceps tendon just to orient myself, and it gives you a good idea of where things are in there, and there&#039;s often a lot of hemorrhagic bursa that you have to kind of get out of the way.  So, the biceps tendon is kind of the first thing I go for to orient myself in &ndash; on the shaft an in the proximal fragments more proximally.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Cuff Tear</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>Sometimes you&#039;ll have a cuff tear that goes longitudinally into the supraspinatus tendon, particularly in the four-part fractures, but aggressive mobilization of the tuberosities and the soft tissues I think is something that you really want to try to avoid.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Brown&#039;s Retractor</font></i></p><p>One of the tricks that I have is the Browns deltoid retractor is almost like an ice cream scoop that you can put under the deltoid, and it has a curve, and the needles can sort of follow that curve.  So, you don&#039;t have to take these tuberosities and pull them way out of the wound to get your sutures through the bone tendon interface, which I think is important because when you do that you just stripped the periosteum.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Patient Positioning</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>I am very simplistic, so, actually, what I do, I use a standard operating able with a bean bag, and I inflate the bean bag flat, and I use that as a sliding board so I can bring my patient a bit more to the edge, so I can actually see – and I pretest with my C-arm to make sure I get appropriate views.</p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>Sometimes I use a Jackson table if I know I&#039;m going to fix a fracture, and I&#039;ll bring the C-arm in from the other side so it&#039;s not coming up over the patient&#039;s head.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Implant Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>That brings up the issue of what tools do you guys have in the operating room, and I think some of that will depend on fracture pattern, head vascularity and all these fixability, feasibility and fixation and things like that, but one of the other things is, in terms of getting the equipment into the room, do you guys typically call to have an arthroplasty available if you&#039;re on the fence about something?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Arthroplasty Availability</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p><i><font size="-2">Longer Plates</font></i></p><p>Yes, especially for the three or four-part fractures or elderly individual, I like to have that available.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Hemi-Arthroplasty</font></i></p><p>Other than that, obviously proximal, humerus, contoured, locking plates, sort of my implant of choice for these fractures.</p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>Yes, the same.  If I&#039;m going to treat a proximal humerus fracture with an open reduction internal fixation it&#039;s going to typically for me be a pre-contoured locked device.  The elderly patient with very significant osteoporosis and thin tuberosities I have a hemiarthroplasty available.  But usually those decisions are made, if I can, before I go in the operating room.</p><p>The things that push me into the realm of a hemiarthroplasty would be the head splitting component, the fractured dislocation where the head is somewhere anteriorally up under the conjoin tendon.  I know pretty much that those are going to be arthroplasties, and I&#039;m not going to really attempt to do open reduction, internal fixation on those specific patterns.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Reduction Technique</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>One of the other points I think is that, I agree, usually what I&#039;ll try to do is oftentimes you&#039;ll see that little longitudinal split in the supraspinatus tendon just posterior to the biceps, and because you don&#039;t really have tendon detachment from bone, it&#039;s legal to just continue that longitudinal split with some Metzenbaum scissors, and you can open that up there and peak inside.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Anterior K-Wire</font></i></p><p>You can use, I agree, like a Cobb or a joker or something to sort of perch that medial metaphyseal segment back onto the shaft, and once you get that, you can come from anterior with a K-wire, totally away form your plate and start low and skewer the bottom part of that head.  And that will hold that medial metaphyseal relationship and kind of allow you to tip it up laterally and then get your tuberosities underneath.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"Proximal Humerus Fractures",title:"Pitfalls and Complications",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_04",script:'<p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>What about pitfalls and things, problems that you can run into in some of these cases?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Imaging</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>When setting up I think you really need to be careful about making sure you&#039;re going to be able to image properly.  I think the first pitfall you&#039;re going to fall is poor imaging, and unless you have a specialized attachment to your operating table, you&#039;re going to have to think about that ahead of time.  If you don&#039;t have good imaging, you&#039;re going to mess up your reduction in terms of restoring anatomy and tuberosities and so forth.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Tuberosity Issues</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>The main issue is the tuberosities, usually most of these patients are elderly and dealing with significant osteopenia and fragile tuberosities.  So, I guess I try to make an attempt to handle them as little as possible, and I try to gain control on the tuberosities with sutures at the bone-tendon junction because that&#039;s your strongest &ndash; often more strong than the weak tuberosity pieces of bone.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Suture Technique</font></i></p><p>So, I usually will put sutures at the bone tendon and junction kind of an initial step to gain control of the lesser tuberosity fragment and the greater tuberosity fragment as a way to control the proximal fragments.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Postoperative Function</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>Tuberosities is what the post-operative function is all about: restoration of the tuberosities to the head fragment is the key, and the less that you can mobilize them and sort of keep them in situ the better.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Non-aggressive Reduction</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I think the greater tuberosity, the most you can just sort of leave it in the back until the very end when you&#039;re going to try to get your reduction, whether it&#039;s for a plate or for an arthroplasty, I think the key is not to aggressively mobilize these things and to really try and respect the biology of it.</p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>How about getting your head reduced to the shaft, Ken, any pearls or pitfalls there?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Head Reduction</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>In the geriatric patient, remarkably, even though the bone quality is poor, the reduction I find is a bit easier.  I will try and reduce it either with a COB or manually, and I will immediately use bone graft to kind of keep it in position before, as I bring my tuberosities into an anatomic position.  I find that it is very difficult to preemptively keep a geriatric, small head in position with your plate.  You can actually be applying your locking screws with the head already falling into varus, so it doesn&#039;t happen postop, it actually happens intraop.  And I wonder what percent of the reductions are actually happening intraop versus early on.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Reducing the Head</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>One of the other techniques I&#039;ve seen used for &ndash; as you were asking about getting the head reduced and held in place to the shaft is actually coming in with the K-wires or Steinmann pin from up top.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Varus/Valgus Control</font></i></p><p>This is maybe more applicable if the greater tuberosity is attached or a larger chunk of the greater tuberosity is attached, and driving that K-wire or Steinmann pin through the head component, obviously, through the neck, into the medial part of the shaft, and that can help hold it in place and prevent it from falling into excessive varus or valgus while you&#039;re doing the bone grafting and plate fixation to avoid because sometimes I found the screws that are coming &ndash; the K-wires that are coming from the shaft up may be in a place of a plate if you don&#039;t plot it out strategically.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1634A/M1634A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"}]},discuss3:{data:[{category:"Proximal Humerus Fractures Part II",title:"Avoiding Problems",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1605A/M1605A_01",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Rotator Cuff Sutures</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Summers:</b></p><p>I would say that I almost always place sutures in the rotator cuff tendons.  It helps you - it serves also as a joystick, not only to fix fracture fragments, but you can use it to help you correct the rotation of your head.  And even if they&#039;re attached to the head fragment, I think some stitches in the rotator cuff will help you kind of rotate the fracture a bit.  It kind of helps me a lot.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Drill-Tipped K-Wires</font></i></p><p>I would say that in some young patients that have really hard bone, and you&#039;re trying to place some K-wires, just to kind of get things held together before you place your plate, the K-wires can be very difficult to place, because they want to skive off the bone.  They&#039;re hard to place in that hard cortical bone in the shaft.  So there are some drill-tip K-wires from locking plate systems have drill-tipped K-wires.  So every now and then, in young patients with really hard bone, it&#039;s a good trick that I&#039;ve found, using a drill-tipped K-wire, so you can get through that hard cortical bone in the shaft, and get one good wire up into the head, to kind of help you hold things together, has been very helpful for some of the younger patients with really displaced high-energy fractures.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Deltopectoral Issues</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I think one problem that people have - especially with fixing fractures through a deltopectoral incision is how to get screws into the proximal segment through the guides, with the deltoid in the way.  That tends to be a very difficult problem.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Abduct Arm for Proximal  Screws</font></i></p><p>And so just some tips for managing that is - one is to abduct the arm, to partially relax the deltoid.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Internally Rotate Arm for Anterior Screws</font></i></p><p>To internally rotate the arm just a little bit, to provide a little more access to the more anterior screws.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Place Anterior Screw First</font></i></p><p>And then in the proximal segment, to place the anterior screws first, to allow for then some more aggressive rotation of the arm, so that you can continue to internally rotate, and then access the more posterior screws.  So I think that&#039;s been helpful for managing the deltoid.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Screw Placement</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>I&#039;d say my focus is a little bit on these screws.  And sometimes, it doesn&#039;t put the plate proximally right where you want it.  But it seems like if these screws are a little low and need to be stopped here, then these screws are up higher.  I&#039;m not sure it makes a huge difference.  But I tend to kind of position the plate based on where those inferior screws are going to be.  And then the indirect reductions, which we looked at a little bit - tend to do more frequently than not, probably.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Get Contralateral X-Rays</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Evans:</b></p><p>I would say, from an evaluation standpoint, something that I do almost always is get x-rays of the uninjured contralateral shoulder.  And I have them up.  I know a lot of people don&#039;t feel that&#039;s necessary.  But I&#039;ve found that I was underestimating, or maybe being over impressed, with my reduction, and thinking that I had it in an anatomic restoration of the appropriate valgus neck shaft angle.  And almost always, when I would go back to look at the contralateral film, I was not quite as anatomic as I thought, and I needed to get it a little bit more out of varus.  So I have found that to be very helpful, to get an uninjured shoulder view, and have that up in the operating room to look at.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Get Axillary and AP Views Without Moving Arm</font></i></p><p>I think the second thing that I always make sure I can do - and it was brought up earlier - is being able to get an AP and an axillary view without moving the arm.  So I can get one view.  Hold the arm - and my reduction in the exact spot.  Get the axillary view, so that I can confirm that my plate is not going to be put too anterior.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Multiple K-Wires Provisional Fixation</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Barei:</b></p><p>You know in my hands, I&#039;ve personally found using a lot of provisional K-wires to be a really good way that I can obtain - maintain a provisional reduction; confirm it with my C-arm.  And as Dr. Nork said, it takes a bit of anticipation of where you think your plate&#039;s going go.  But just getting a few K-wires that bridge the neck portion - the surgical neck fracture portion - can really start to stabilize the reduction a heck of a lot, before you start getting the plate on.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Bone Quality Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gorczyca:</b></p><p>Well, you know these are some of the most enjoyable cases I do, and also some of the most disheartening.  So if people are fixing them, they should be ready for both.  There&#039;s a lot of marketing going on right now.  And people should keep in mind that the weak link in the fixation construct is the patient&#039;s bone - much more significant than the shape of the implant or the type of the implant or the diameter of the screws or shape of anything.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Osteoporosis</font></i></p><p>And also keep in mind that as physicians, we should be making sure these patients are being treated for osteoporosis.  Because most of them will have a significant degree of that.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1605A/M1605A_01.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Proximal Humerus Fractures Part II",title:"Surgical Approach Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1605A/M1605A_02",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Anterior Lateral Acromial Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>So we talked a little bit earlier on some different approaches to proximal humerus fractures.  I&#039;ve kind of gravitated, in most cases, towards the anterolateral acromial approach, by making an incision off of the anterolateral corner of the deltoid and finding the axillary nerve.  I think the reduction ends up being a little bit easier.  The incision ends up, invariably, being right at the intertuberosity split, and so you can really work the tuberosities better.  It seems like it&#039;s easier to mobilize the greater tuberosity, and doesn&#039;t require internal rotation to the fracture site.  Certainly there are ways around that.  The dominant - potentially one of the dominant blood supplies to the head, off of the anterior humeral circumflex, is kind of maintained out of the surgical dissection field.  But certainly I think that - </p><p><i><font size="-2">Identifying the Axillary Nerve</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>Do you see the axillary nerve every time you do that approach?</p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>Yes.  I think that&#039;s an important point, with the overall trend towards minimally invasive, or percutaneous, surgery.  The proximal humerus has been a target of that.  And I think that&#039;s a great point.  You know the screws that are really potentially the best screws in the head will almost always directly spear the nerve, if the nerve isn&#039;t identified.  So I find the nerve every time.  I think it&#039;s a more biologically friendly approach, but it&#039;s not a shorter incision.  It&#039;s not a minimal incision.  So I find the nerve and put a vessel loop around it, and then extend distally and expose the shaft.  You know it&#039;s important to center the plate on the shaft too, which isn&#039;t always easy.  And it&#039;s a relatively small surface that can be a little bit anterior or posterior, and not get bicortical screws in the shaft.  So I think it&#039;s important to find the nerve.  And then once it&#039;s identified and kind of protected with a vessel loop, you don&#039;t need any tension or traction on it.  But you just know where it is, and you can move it out of the away to put those screws in.  But that is kind of a direct approach to the plating zone.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Metaphyseal Extension</font></i></p><p>And if you really have metaphyseal extension, where clamps in the metaphyseal region would help, I think it&#039;s hard to do that through a lateral approach.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Hemiarthroplasty</font></i></p><p>We&#039;ve converted one to a hemi.  And that&#039;s another question that comes up: can you do a hemi through it?  And you can.  It&#039;s a little harder.  You really need to be cognizant of the nerve position.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Deltopectoral Approach for Older Fractures</font></i></p><p>And then fractures that are out more than two weeks are a little bit harder, too, to really work within the fracture lines, which you kind of need to do from the lateral approach.  So those, I typically do through a deltopectoral as well.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Anesthesia Relaxation for a Deltopectoral Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gorczyca:</b></p><p>For me, it&#039;s easier.  I don&#039;t have to learn anything new.  And I really haven&#039;t had a problem with it.  A couple of things that are helpful are if the anesthesiologist relaxes the patient.  That takes a lot of tension off the deltoid - for relaxation.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Release Deltoid Insertion</font></i></p><p>And I release about 25 percent of the anterior deltoid at its insertion, so that things can be pulled out of the way.  But it&#039;s also extensile, so you can put a plate that goes all the way down to the distal humeral shaft, if need be.  Occasionally, I use a deltoid split for greater tuberosity fractures, or for exchanging screws that cut through, if I&#039;ve used a deltopectoral incision previously.  But, for the most part, the deltopectoral incision is the workhorse, and I stick with that.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Deltopectoral Approach Pearls</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>But I think with the deltopectoral approach - I just like, I guess more than anything, the flexibility of the approach, in that I don&#039;t have to worry if something comes up unexpected, and I have to convert to a different procedure.  And if I need to place a longer plate, I can simply extend the incision.  And I think the familiarity - I think is important, just because you do a lot of procedures through that approach.  But mobilizing and stabilizing the greater tuberosity is definitely more difficult through that approach.  And it is a less direct approach.  But it is what I typically favor, more than anything, because of its utility and flexibility. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1605A/M1605A_02.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"Proximal Humerus Fractures Part II",title:"Patient Positioning",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1605A/M1605A_03",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Beach Chair Position</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>Do you think there&#039;s a role for a beach chair position, Dr. Barei, in proximal humerus fractures?</p><p><b>Dr. Barei:</b></p><p>I think that most people that are also doing other shoulder procedures that are non-fracture care might be more comfortable with the beach chair position.  I think for me, personally, the geriatric fracture that may intraoperatively become converted to a hemiarthroplasty - I think that the beach chair position allows that conversion perhaps a little easier than in the supine position.  So that may be one of the advantages.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Physiologically Easier</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>Why is that though?</p><p><b>Dr. Barei:</b></p><p>I think it gives the ability to extend the shoulder and work in a more physiologically easy ability for the surgeon, and a more vertical nature, to get the prosthesis and trial the prosthesis and move the arm around, with the patient in a beach chair position, rather than supine, where the arm has to be substantially hyperextended and free to do those same trial reductions and manipulations of the shaft.</p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>So maybe more familiar with people who focus more on shoulder procedures, but difficult to position on a multiply injured patient, maybe, in the beach chair position, as we mentioned earlier.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Isolated injury</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I like the beach chair for patients who have an isolated injury, especially an elderly patient with just an isolated proximal humerus fracture.</p><p>I think the imaging is definitely not as good as you get with the supine positioning, where you can get a very predictable AP and axillary lateral.  I think especially the axillary imaging is more difficult.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Imaging Not as Good</font></i></p><p>But I essentially work in the axillary, with the arm somewhat abducted while they&#039;re in the beach chair position.  That relaxes the deltoid somewhat, and then I can use gravity to help regain length.  I think it&#039;s just a - it&#039;s a very comfortable position, and it doesn&#039;t require a lot of assistance, if you place them in the beach chair position.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Arm Holder</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>Great.  So definitely gravity&#039;s working more for you.  So do you tend to have the arm in one of the adjustable arm holders?</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I tend to just bring in a padded Mayo stand and place the elbow on a padded Mayo stand, so I can adjust the height of that, to adjust the flexion and extension of the fracture.</p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>Dr. Summers, when you do use a beach chair, how do you end up getting the axillary view.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Beach Chair Axillary View</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Summers:</b></p><p>I rarely use the beach chair, actually.  I think the supine positioning is so much easier for me to image.  And I can reliably get the same AP and axillary view every time, because I position the patient the same way every time.  And, for me, it&#039;s just much easier.  In the beach chair position, you can still get an axillary.  You can bring the C-arm kind of over the top a little bit more.  And abduct the arm a little bit, and still get a good axillary x-ray.  But you have to, I think, really make sure that you&#039;re getting truly orthogonal views.  When you want to understand your reduction, you want to have orthogonal views of the proximal humerus.  So as long as you make sure that you do that in the beach chair position, you can still image it.  I think it&#039;s a little bit more difficult, for me anyway.</p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>People have talked about kind of flipping the C-arm over, and bringing it over the top and under for the orthogonal views.  But yes, maybe just a preference thing - drawbacks and benefits of each.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1605A/M1605A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"}]},discuss4:{data:[{category:"OperatRoive Vs Non-operative Treatment of Humeral Shaft Fractures",title:"Initial Assessment",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1496A/M1496A_01",script:'<p><b>Dr. Miranda:</b></p><p>We&#039;re here for a roundtable discussion regarding humerus fractures.

Patients who are multi trauma, who require the upper extremity for weight bearing may be one indication.  Patients who have open fractures may be another indication.  My indications are really narrow for operating on these without a trial of conservative management for the most part.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Initial Assessment</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>If I see their initial radiographs with significant distraction or some other injury to perhaps the brachial plexus with a distraction, that would certainly encourage me to pursue a more aggressive operative treatment plan.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Ambulation</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>And I become a bit more aggressive with, as you say, the patients that require their upper extremity for ambulation and so in Maine, there&#039;s a significant elderly population, and so when an elderly patient falls and breaks their humerus who previously used a cane, lives independently, or uses a walker, that may be a person that I&#039;m not even going let them have a trial of nonoperative management because they use their extremity to ambulate. And so that may be another patient that for me I take early to the operating room.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Pain Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Harris:</b></p><p>I think the comments about nonoperative management are on point, although pain is also another determinant for me in terms of operating versus non-operating.  Some patients just cannot tolerate the attempt at nonoperative management.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Patient Expectations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Harris:</b></p>When surgery is decided upon, the biggest thing I want to know is what the patient&#039;s expectations are and what the patient&#039;s job and requirements of that extremity are.

I&#039;m happy to place patients in a humeral fracture brace.  I&#039;d let them sit in a coaptation splint for a couple of weeks.  I don&#039;t really care how displaced they are.  If I think they&#039;re really shortened, I might try a hanging arm cast.  But if initial presentation, even after six weeks, I&#039;m pretty unconcerned with the initial amount of displacement and I&#039;m happy to use a series of braces.  I&#039;ve used all sorts of bolsters underneath the elbow in order to correct varus and I&#039;m happy to treat the vast majority of these, even with the displacement, conservatively.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1496A/M1496A_01.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"OperatRoive Vs Non-operative Treatment of Humeral Shaft Fractures",title:"Pitfalls And Complications",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1496A/M1496A_02",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Non-Surgical Techniques</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>I think that many of us have lost the art of treating these fractures non surgically.  That is, we&#039;re not very good at applying coaptation splints because it requires a lot of work and a lot of effort.  We don&#039;t do a great job of molding the fracture braces to correct angular deformity and so I think the wolf in sheep&#039;s clothing is ourselves.  We haven&#039;t been trained well on how to do some of this.  And so I think that the literature will support treating all of these fractures initially conservatively if they don&#039;t have an absolute indication for surgery but recent evidence would suggest that the non-union rate is much higher than we originally thought.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Non-Union Rates</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>So I think that traditionally people have sort of reported non-union rates of upwards of 5 to 10 percent with humeral shaft fractures, but their recent series presented in our trauma conference at the OTA, there was 25 percent non-union rate in fractures treated conservatively while those that were treated surgically actually had a non-union rate of about 5 percent.

Am I going to bridge that fracture and in that case, it makes it actually a bit more straightforward. I can simply restore length, alignment, rotation and secure the plate at both ends.  When I decide that I&#039;m going to get anatomic reduction and stable fixation, the reduction can be challenging.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1496A/M1496A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"OperatRoive Vs Non-operative Treatment of Humeral Shaft Fractures",title:"Technical Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1496A/M1496A_04",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Function</font></i></p><b>Dr. Harris:</b></p><p>You know we&#039;re talking about shortening and ambulation, but functionally, nobody&#039;s shown that shortening and ambulation really affects the humerus. Dave Ring looked up operative versus nonoperative and I was surprised to see the function was no different at all.  The conclusion on the paper was you could do it either way.  The infections of nerves were higher in the nonoperative.  So I think shortening and some varus is okay functionally, even though we don&#039;t like the looks of it in our clinic and follow-up.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Accepted Healed Deformity</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>There&#039;s no doubt about it.  I mean I think that I&#039;d be very satisfied with a healed humerus in 30 degrees of apex anterior angulation or up to 15, 20 degrees of varus, especially in a larger patient if they don&#039;t mind that.  It&#039;s the union problem that I think is an issue that we under appreciate.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Thin Arm Challenge</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>I think young patients with thin arms, I think, we do have to pay attention to that.  If you have a very large arm, it&#039;s very easy to hide 20 degrees angulation and if you&#039;ve got skinny little arms, you can&#039;t hide it.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Radial Nerve Concerns</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>Any of these that I treat operatively, I have a long discussion with the patient about radial nerve issues.  Certainly most of these approaches, the radial nerves have some degree of risk and I think my first discussion with the patient is about radial nerve injuries, infections, and persistent non-unions.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Cosmetic Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>I think, as well, there is a cosmetic issue for some of my patients which I try not to pay a lot of attention to but I think it&#039;s out there.  It&#039;s real.  I think the posterior scars aren&#039;t any bigger or any less cosmetic but you can&#039;t see them as well.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Posterior Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>So I think those patients who have cosmetic issues with a large open approach, I&#039;m more likely to go posterior than I am to go anterolateral where the scars are more likely to be visible.  It&#039;s kind of a silly consideration but I think it&#039;s come up a couple of times for me.</p><p><b>Dr. Miranda:</b></p><p>Well, I wouldn&#039;t say it&#039;s silly.  If it affects the patient&#039;s satisfaction then that&#039;s something that we should be attentive to.</p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>It&#039;s come up for me a couple of times with patients who are considering a surgery which is certainly not emergent and more or less can be done on an elective basis for an established non-union.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Fracture Location</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>Well, for me, it&#039;s really the location of the fracture, so if it&#039;s in a proximal, one-third proximal, two-thirds radial anterolateral plate.  I think if it gets more distal than that, then I&#039;ll do a posterior.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Severity of Injury</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>It also is important to consider the overall patient and so a poly trauma patient that perhaps I can&#039;t roll on their other side in position to do a posterior approach, then I might do that either direct lateral or even anterolateral.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Bone Graft Types</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Miranda:</b></p><p>Mitch, when do you graft a humerus fracture and what type of graft would you use?</p><p><b>Dr. Harris:</b></p><p>So the only time I would graft a humerus fracture if it was a non-union.  I would not do primary grafting ever of a humerus fracture and if I was going to graft a non-union, I would take crest and then combine it with other things, whether I ended up using a BMP product or additional autologeous bone, then we&#039;ve also been using some of the RIA techniques to get to the bone graft, as well.  It&#039;s a little bit of a harder sell on the humerus explaining that you&#039;re going go into the femur to get bone graft, but if you&#039;re down getting the pelvic bone graft anyway, you can easily get into the troch entry site and you can use a RIA.  So I&#039;ve been using a combination of different things for a atrophic non-unions. I don&#039;t bone graft them acutely.</p><p><i><font size="-2">RIA</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Harris:</b></p><p>So the RIA is a reamer irrigator aspirator and it&#039;s actually a relatively non-flexible reamer that takes off mostly just the endosteal cortex but mostly cells and slight amounts of bone chips in the endosteal cortex.   So it&#039;s a combination, of bone and cells that should be potential cells and also very osteogenic material.  My concern would be how do you keep it contained in some of the humerus after you gather it?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Autograft vs. Allograft</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>I have a discussion with my patients about the risk and benefits of their own bone, of allograft and bone substitutes, which I tend to put in the same category, and occasionally I think there&#039;s a role for BMP but that&#039;s quite unusual.</p><p><i><font size="-2">No Acute Bone Graft</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Miranda:</b></p><p>In the acute setting?</p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>Not in the acute setting.

I haven&#039;t used a lot of iliac crest aspiration but I think there&#039;s probably a role for that, as well.  I do with very little hesitation use allograft bone substitutes in patients who don&#039;t want me to use their crest and I think there&#039;s data to support that.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Acute Bone Grafting?</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Miranda:</b></p><p>Can I ask you to address the acute situation?</p><p><b>Dr. Wixted:</b></p><p>Not in the acute situation.</p><p><i><font size="-2">RIA</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Miranda:</b></p><p>Matt?</p><p><b>Dr. Camuso:</b></p><p>No, I don&#039;t do any acute bone grafting, particularly just in the &ndash; oligotrophic and atrophic non-unions and I will use RIA.

Most companies nowadays have the implants that are somewhat fracture specific, that have been designed to incorporate bone grafts, or optimize tuberosity healing, or lower the profile of the lateral neck.  Do you guys have any particular thoughts about implant-related factors or design issues that you think are relevant to fixing these fractures and getting an adequate reduction in tuberosity fixation?</p><p><i><font size="-2">System Related Factors</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>I think definitely, like you mentioned, improvements have been made in actually minimizing the amount of metal in the proximal metaphyseal portion of these implants, making them smaller, making voids in the metal, where you can actually put bone from the head, that usually they&#039;ll come with some type of cutting device to shape the bone from the head to put in these voids.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Hemi-Arthroplasty Considerations</font></i></p><p>It certainly, I think, enhances the chances of tuberosities healing around an implant, which hemi-arthroplasty for fracture for me is probably one of the most difficult operations to get correct, mainly because it&#039;s difficult to get the height of the implant just right.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Gauging the Height</font></i></p><p>And if you have a - if the fracture is right at the anatomic neck medially, then you have a pretty good idea right where to place that implant, but when it&#039;s not there, it&#039;s more difficult to judge exactly where the height should be.  There&#039;s radiographic measurements that you can take preoperatively.  It&#039;s difficult to control for magnification on those, so I&#039;ve found that to be somewhat cumbersome and not that helpful.  I&#039;ve gone to basically bring a C-arm in and making sure my height is right, and that has been helpful.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Over-Reduction</font></i></p><p>And another problem with hemi-arthroplasty that makes it difficult is, even if you have good pieces of bone to get around the implant, it&#039;s often when you cinch these cerclage sutures around these tuberosities, you can often bring them down further than you think you are, and you look in the wound and it looks beautiful.  Then you look at your x-ray and the tuberosity is a lot further down, over-reduced.  So, that&#039;s been the two things that I&#039;ve really struggled with is getting the height of the implant right and then not over-reducing the tuberosities.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Low Profile Implant</font></i></p><p>I think the lower profile implants, the newer ones that allow for bone graft to be placed proximally certainly are better than those older ones where there&#039;s just a lot of metal up there, and you don&#039;t have the ability to bone graft, and you&#039;re putting a real thin tuberosity to this big piece of metal.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1575/M1575A_01.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Shoulder Arthroplasty",title:"Technical Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1575A/M1575A_02",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Contralateral Side Image</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>I agree with the difficulty establishing the height.  In fact, when I end up doing an arthroplasty because I couldn&#039;t fix it, so I take full advantage of the C-arm, which I have in the room because I initially planned to fix it. And I will go as far as perhaps getting an image from the opposite side, not because we can always make good use of it, but most of the time we can actually look at the contour with the proximal humerus, once you have your trial in and kind of estimate height of your input.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Maintaining Trial Position</font></i></p><p>The other problem with some of these systems is it&#039;s hard to keep the trial in place when you&#039;re trying to trial it, because the trial keeps pistoning down.  So, any system that has an ability to correct for that would be a good addition.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Reverse Total Shoulder</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>A question I have along those lines is if you can not get - if the tuberosity is significantly comminuted and cannot be restored, have any of you considered doing a primary reverse total shoulder, which is something I heard of some surgeons doing in Europe, I believe, doing a primary reverse total shoulder arthroplasty, when you cannot restore a rotator cuff attachment to the humerus?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Cuff Attachment – Reverse Shoulder</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I&#039;ve done about five or six of those, and I think it&#039;s a reasonable option if you have somebody who&#039;s very elderly and sedentary, but certainly in a younger person I wouldn&#039;t do it.  I think even in those cases, though, you still want to try to get some cuff attached, and so, I think no matter what, you want to make your best effort at getting cuff attachment back to the prosthesis, because even in those reverse cases, if you don&#039;t get some external rotator function back then they end up with that post-operative horn blower sign.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Articular Cartilage Margin</font></i></p><p>One of the tricks that I use, I think if you look at the length of the medial metaphyseal segment on the head, you can take the head out, and when you&#039;re sizing it on the back table relative to your various prostheses head sizes, you can see the margin of the articular cartilage medially.  Because you&#039;ve got the shaft exposed, you can figure out where it kind of keys in, so you know where the medial segment is, and you can look at the distance of that medial metaphyseal portion of bone. And that basically gives you the head height above the shaft, where you want that head to seat in terms of restoring that calcar line.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Medial Metaphyseal Void</font></i></p><p>You may, when you put your prosthesis in, actually have some void there where there&#039;s some space between the under-surface of the prosthetic head and the top part of the shaft, because there used to be medial metaphyseal bone there that&#039;s gone now.  I think some people used to look at that and say, &quot;Geez, that doesn&#039;t look good.  That bone&#039;s uncovered,&quot; but that doesn&#039;t matter from a load-bearing perspective.  You don&#039;t need to have bone there, and that&#039;s just one little trick of determining where the height is.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1575/M1575A_02.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"Shoulder Arthroplasty",title:"Tips And Pearls",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1575A/M1575A_03",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Tuberosity  Fixation Techniques</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons</b></p><p>Anybody have any technical tricks as far as how you fix your tuberosities, how you rigidly restore them to the prosthesis?</p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>I use number five non-absorbable sutures, and I use six of them, and it&#039;s a technique that Pascal Boileau popularized, and Sumant Krishnan.  Basically, I have four sutures, they go outside in through the greater tuberosity, and two sutures through drill holes in the shaft.  Two of those four sutures go around the greater tuberosity and the lesser tuberosity, and cerclage those together.  Two of them are just going around the greater tuberosity.  I put the greater tuberosity down first with two sutures, and then the other two sutures grab the lesser, and kind of encompass both tuberosities.  Then the sutures through the shaft, basically one goes posterially and tension bands the posterior cuff and supraspinatus, and one goes anteriorly and tension bands the subscapularis and supraspinatus.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Sternal Wire</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>I do something very similar to what you described to the tuberosities.  I use a sternal wire, which you can get from the Cardiac suite, and it comes with a needle, so you don&#039;t have to have a specialized cable system, and it works the same way.</p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>Even for - mostly for plate reconstruction and geriatric as well as the young patient, I will always at the end of the case tension band reinforcement around the tuberosity, and I will use either a sternal wire or an ETHIBOND suture.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Nerve Injury</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>I think it&#039;s a pretty high incident of, actually, nerve palsy or nerve praxia that you really want to,  in your preoperative clinical exam, get an idea of if the deltoids firing or not, and a lot of times they&#039;re so painful you really can&#039;t even get them to fire their deltoid. But it&#039;s one thing to at least make your patient aware of that you suspect maybe an axillary nerve injury, but we&#039;re going to proceed with the operation and we expect it to recover.  At least at that point, you&#039;ve broached the subject with them and they&#039;re aware of it.  If you have an x-ray postoperatively where the humeral head is subluxed inferiorly, then you&#039;ve already had that discussion with them.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Plexus Neurapraxia</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I think that&#039;s a good point, and I would agree.  It may be underappreciated, but nerve injuries or plexus neurapraxias is probably more common than we appreciate.  If you have a scaling nerve block, you&#039;ll often see that inferior subluxation on your immediate postop x-ray, and your radiologist will call you up worried about something.  But that usually snugs back in when their cuff flexion returns.</p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>That - like I said, that&#039;s usually something that&#039;s achievable and you can get stable fixation.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1575/M1575A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"Shoulder Arthroplasty",title:"Pitfalls And Complications",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1575A/M1575A_04",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Over-Reduction Potential</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>The part that&#039;s been disheartening is looking at that x-ray and seeing that I&#039;ve inadvertently over-tightened things and reduced them too much.</p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I think that&#039;s the biggest technical downfall is that, I agree, you look at it during surgery and it looks perfect.

They don&#039;t stretch out and the knots don&#039;t loosen over time, and I use two cerclage cables.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1575/M1575A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"},{category:"Shoulder Arthroplasty",title:"Avoiding Problems",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1575A/M1575A_05",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Tuberosity/Shaft Connection</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>So, do you have a connection between the tuberosities and the shaft?</p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>No.  No direct connection.  The other thing that I noticed early on, some of the prosthesis designs just will have a smooth edge between on the medial calcar segment, for when you put those cerclage sutures around so they don&#039;t abrade on the stem and rupture, and if you don&#039;t actually have your cerclage - if your cerclage cables or sutures are going around the stem, but they&#039;re not directly attached to the stem, when you rotate that humeral shaft, and the ball rotates in the glenoid, your tuberosities can rotate relative to the shaft, because the cerclage is going around, but there&#039;s no direct attachment.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Micromotion </font></i></p><p>I would see cases where you take that ETHIBOND, and you&#039;d strangulate the tuberosities, and you&#039;d have sutures going all over the place.

So, I like to put abundant bone graft under there to give the tuberosities some offset.</p><p><b>Dr. Hobgood:</b></p><p>That&#039;s another mistake that I&#039;ve made, not bone grafting it initially, because the tuberosity can look kind of big, but it&#039;s really just a shell, just as you mentioned, and once you cinch it down, it really just crushes right down on the implant, and you want to bulk up with graft, always.  Something I definitely do now is certainly always bone graft on that lateral side of the implant to support the greater tuberosity.</p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>Just one of the clinical twists to this scenario that you described.  Say you get a patient - see what you guys think about this.  You get a patient who has a severe fracture dislocation.  It&#039;s clearly going to be an arthroplasty treatment option, but the head has dislocated into the axilla, deep into the axilla.  Have you encountered these cases where you&#039;re just inclined to leave the head there to avoid neurovascular injury?  This is just in terms of decision-making, what would push you one way or the other?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Leave the Head?</font></i></p><p>To perform the arthroplasty and leave the head fragment in the axilla to avoid possibly - this is possibly somebody who&#039;s presenting late, not necessarily an acute presentation, which probably could get the head out in that case.  Have you seen anything like that?  Because I&#039;ve seen one case.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Neurovascular Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>I have not, but if it was a late presentation and it was really scarred in down by the axillary nerve I guess I&#039;d be pretty scared.</p><p><b>Dr. Golant:</b></p><p>I&#039;ve seen one case with a vascular injury.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Remove the Head</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Rodriguez:</b></p><p>For my practice that&#039;s not an unusual presentation.  We do a lot of high-energy trauma.  Many times I have fished these heads from close to the ribcage.  So, the point with that particular scenario is, if it happens in a 20-year-old kid, I would still use the head and still repair it, rather than proceed with arthroplasty, even though the risk of AVN is pretty much guaranteed at that point.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1575/M1575A_05.jpg",vidndx:"4"},{category:"Shoulder Arthroplasty",title:"Things I Now Do Differently",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1575A/M1575A_06",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Supraspinatus/Rotator Cuff Interval</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Parsons:</b></p><p>Just one other technical thing that I&#039;ll bring up, which is something that I didn&#039;t invent, but I just learned along the way from good teachers, is, I think in these cases of arthroplasty, the lesser tuberosity fracture fragment usually contains the bicipital groove and a small portion of the anterior part of the greater tuberosity, which has a portion of the supraspinatus attached to it.  So, the soft tissue violation, as I&#039;ve already said, usually goes through the front part of the supraspinatus tendon, and the rotator interval is fully intact in these patients, and you can work through that defect.</p><p>The tendency, for those of us who do shoulder arthroplasty for degenerative conditions, is to open up the rotator interval, open up the bicipital groove, follow the interval, and follow it all the way back and mobilize that whole thing. But I think in these fracture cases, you should not violate that rotator interval if it&#039;s not already violated, because when you do that you&#039;re really going to destabilize your tuberosities, and if you keep that rotator interval intact, I think it&#039;s going to help keep those tuberosities together as a unit. And you can split that supraspinatus longitudinally, and that&#039;s very repairable because you don&#039;t have tendon that&#039;s detached from the bone. And through that split, you can usually get in with a Kocher, and you can grab the humeral head, and you can sort of pry it out.  You can inspect the glenoid.  You usually have sufficient visualization, and then you can pull the shaft out, and you can reduce things back under there, and then you can close that side-to-side at the end.  But I think it&#039;s a mistake to just go to open up the rotator interval in these cases if you can avoid it.  That&#039;s just one of these things that I used to do.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1575/M1575A_06.jpg",vidndx:"5"}]},discuss6:{data:[{category:"Diaphyseal Fractures of the Humerus",title:"Initial Assessment",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_01",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Management Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>So, today we&#039;re going to talk about humeral diaphyseal fractures.  The interesting thing, whenever I get into these discussions about a fracture pattern is it seems that, although we all see patients, and we get a feel for the ones we operate on, and the ones we don&#039;t operate on, when we get into a discussion setting, I find that the indications are not always as clear as we think they are.  What do you find are your major indications for or against operative management of these shaft fractures?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Nonoperative Treatment</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p>Well, I think, as you pointed out, a lot of these humeral shaft fractures I think the majority of us would still treat nonoperatively, if they&#039;re isolated.  And I think that&#039;s one thing people tend to forget about is, you can treat a lot of these nonoperatively without surgery, and treat them in Sarmiento braces, or functional braces, and they do quite well.  I think the ones that are problematic are patients statures that can prohibit functional bracing to a good extent, and then the multiply injured patients, as well, at least for me.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Poly-Trauma</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I think that probably ends up being the greatest number of patients, are patients that are poly-traumatized, or need to use their upper extremity because of a lower extremity injury.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Neurovascular Injuries</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I&#039;m sure you all would agree, I tend to operate on open fractures, or if they have an associated brachial plexus injury, or a vascular injury, or bilateral upper extremity injuries, or associated forearm injury.  And I&#039;m also pretty aggressive about radial nerve injuries in terms of operative fixation of the humerus.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Radial Nerve Issues</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>I would agree with that.  I think there is evidence against operating when they have closed injuries and low energy trauma.

I at least discuss with the patient the surgical treatment, although without nerve palsy, I may treat nonoperatively.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_01.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Diaphyseal Fractures of the Humerus",title:"Technical Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_02",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Radial Nerve Palsy</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>So, you&#039;re saying there are some closed, simple humeral diaphyseal fractures with radial nerve palsies that you will operate on because of the radial nerve palsy?</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>Yes.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>You, too?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Recovery Rate</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>Well, I think this is a very difficult point, for obvious reasons, and that&#039;s why it tends to be discussed a lot.  I think the literature&#039;s pretty good in indicating that, if a patient has a primary radial nerve palsy and a closed fracture that they&#039;re very likely, in over 85-percent of cases, to have spontaneous recovery with time, if they&#039;re treated nonoperatively.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Secondary Nerve Palsy</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I think it&#039;s the patients that have a radial nerve palsy associated with an open fracture, or the patients that develop a secondary radial nerve palsy, which is a very rare individual, actually, those are the ones that I&#039;m actually very aggressive on; despite the fact that I think the literature would suggest that the recovery rate in secondary nerve palsies is just as good,  I just can&#039;t live with the knowledge that they had a working nerve that now doesn&#039;t work, and it&#039;s also what I&#039;d want done on my own arm.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Penetrating Injury</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>What about the radial nerve palsy in the setting of a penetrating injury?  Does that sort of push you a little bit more?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I think if it&#039;s a penetrating injury it ends-up being, technically, an open fracture, so you&#039;re going to have to explore and fix the fracture anyway, and you&#039;re going to have to explore it. Are you assuming there&#039;s no fracture, or are you just &ndash; where they have a penetrating trauma?</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>A penetrating with a fracture that you would normally think about treating.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Treat nonoperatively?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Penetrating Injury with Fracture</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>I mean, a lot of these penetrating injuries, sometimes, you have the fracture, and you have some – kind of a burst of bone, but the alignment, often, is relatively good.  And you would normally, if it was – no nerve injury you may just consider washing the wound out, or you know, in some cases, just treating with the antibiotics and splinting.  And not doing a formal debridement.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Debridement Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I think that&#039;s one of those where you go with your kind of experience, and fortunately, we&#039;re at a place where we don&#039;t get a lot of penetrating trauma, and so the blast injuries, low gunshot wounds are always &ndash; they could be just a pure contusion, too.  So you could consider doing that, and I think that would be reasonable.  But, I think you&#039;d have to look at the soft-tissue injury along with that, and then determine whether or not you could treat it expectantly and kind of watch it.  Otherwise, if it&#039;s a fairly large soft-tissue, I think most of us would probably just go ahead and open and explore and do whatever we needed to, to both the bone as well as the nerve injury if it&#039;s there.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Radial Nerve Injury</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>And do you change your approach if there&#039;s a radial nerve injury, like Utku was saying?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Right, like I said, if there&#039;s a radial nerve injury, if it&#039;s extending, you know, a little more distal than I like, then I&#039;ll go posterior.  But fortunately, most of the ones I&#039;ve had to operate on have not had a radial nerve palsy, so I can fix them from the front.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Anteromedial Plate</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>So, do you plate them in the front, or do you plate them laterally?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>No, it&#039;s anteromedial.  You go straight down, move the biceps out of the way, and the majority of the damage done to the brachialis was done by the fracture, and so you move the biceps out of the way, and you&#039;re staring at fracture.  And so, you split whatever brachialis is left, and you&#039;re right there.  And so, it&#039;s worked out well.  I know there&#039;s arguments about &ndash; it&#039;s not on the tension side of the bone, or things like that, but fortunately, I haven&#039;t seen any issues in terms of that.  And we&#039;ve been able to get them up walking on that without any failures or issues.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Hypertrophic Non-Union</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>What do you do if there&#039;s, like, a hypertrophic non-union?  Do we have to go in and clean-up the fracture surfaces, really?</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>It&#039;s been a long time since I&#039;ve seen a nonoperatively treated hypertrophic non-union.  It seems like most of the nonoperatively treated humeral fractures, at least in my experience, have been atrophic.  But, for a hypertrophic, then I would just provide them with increased stability with a plate.</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>But, even if they have been operated on before, if there&#039;s a total hypertrophic non-union, you can take out the implants, and hypothetically at least, you can just put a fixed implant &ndash; or, you can fix it without going into the fracture site and cleaning up, or shortening.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I would agree.  So, if it&#039;s a previously plated, hypertrophic non-union, where I feel like that there was inadequate stability at the primary surgery, then I think, yes, I would just re-plate them, but use a much longer implant, and basically just increase the stability.  Yes, without taking down a hypertrophic non-union, I completely agree.  Just seems like the majority are atrophic.  Those are the ones I consider.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_02.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"Diaphyseal Fractures of the Humerus",title:"Implant Issues",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_03",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Implant Considerations</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>What do you guys do about, the type of implant - your selection of implant?  What kind of guides you in that regard?</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>Usually, I mean you don&#039;t have to do narrow or broad, depending on the size of the patient, broad or narrow, DCP&#039;s usually work well, unless there&#039;s a lot of comminution and you need to do a bridge plating.  Then, in that case, you&#039;re going to need a bit longer plate, and sometimes you may need &ndash; depending on the amount of the size of the fragments you&#039;re going to be putting fixation, you may need some locking plates in a primary case.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>Do you like to go with a single plate applied, or do 90/90 plating?</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>For a primary fracture, I will go just single plate.  I think it works fine.  Unless it&#039;s a revision or a non-union, in that case I have a tendency to go more than one plate, but not all the time; depending on the quality of the bone.  But, normally, I will go just one plate.  The largest plate I can put on, though.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Plate vs. Nail</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I would agree with that.  I tend to be a plater.  I think some people primarily like nails and some people like plates, and I definitely gravitate toward plates, with the exception being pathologic fractures or very extensive and long segmental fractures. But, otherwise I&#039;m a plater.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Plate Size</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I tend to use a single plate, a 4.5-mm plate narrow, unless the bone&#039;s too small, and then I don&#039;t mind going down to a 3.5-mm plate if in a small female where 4.5-mm is just too large.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Being in San Antonio, we have a large Hispanic population, and I&#039;ve been amazed at how small the bones are.  And so, often times, I am going down to a 3.5-mm plate.  I can&#039;t even get a narrow 4.5-mm on a lot of these patients.  So, sometimes to compensate for the smaller implants, I&#039;ll go with a longer working length, and go on the longer plate.  And so, you know, I&#039;d have to say I&#039;ve put more 3.5-mm plates on than 4.5-mm, just because I can&#039;t get that size of a plate on there.  But I agree with Sean. I&#039;m a plater.  I&#039;m not a nailer.  Except for the same indications he said, really segmental comminuted and the pathologic fractures.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Locked Plates</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>People have kind of gone rampant using locked plating everywhere.  I think, still, osteoporosis is one of the biggest indications for using that.  I can&#039;t say that I have not put locked plates on humerus fractures.  It&#039;s probably like a belt and suspenders for me, since I am going down to 3.5-mm, which some people get concerned about those small implants, and I guess I&#039;m hoping that that 3.5-mm locking will give me that added benefit of stability in those patients that are still young and have good bone quality.  So, do we need to do it?  I don&#039;t know.  But, you know, I think if they&#039;re osteoporotic, for sure.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>That would be my primary indication, or if it&#039;s a very distal diaphyseal fracture where the distal segment&#039;s rather short, then I want to take advantage of just fewer points of fixation, even in good bone, then I may be more tempted to use locked implants.  But, I think in the majority of humeral diaphyseal injuries, unlocked plates perform extremely well.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Bridge Plating</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>For me, using something like that would be useful for &ndash; since I&#039;m not a nailer &ndash; would be for a comminuted segment that I just want to kind of bridge and use it for that, as opposed to the one that you can get anatomically.  I haven&#039;t seen it done, and like I said, it&#039;s a little scary for me.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I&#039;d agree with that logic.  It would make more sense to me to do a bridge plating of a comminuted fracture with a minimally invasive technique, but an open technique, then, for simpler, or an oblique.  But people, and I guess yourself included, have had reasonable experience even with simple fracture patterns.</p><p><i><font size="-2">90-90 Plating</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>Do any of you guys have an indication for doing a 90/90 plating in these non-unions?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Probably a recalcitrant non-union that&#039;s already undergone several platings, maybe, but I&#039;ve never had to do that.  But, just from some of the cases I&#039;ve seen of people that got plated, went on to non-union, get plated again, and then for whatever reason people have tried 90/90, but I&#039;ve never had to do it.</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>The ones I have done that were two plates, and it&#039;s true at the fracture site, are the ones with the low bone quality, either it has been because of the systemic diseases or medications like RA, rheumatoid arthritis, or alcoholics that the bone quality is really poor.  I don&#039;t feel like the purchase I get, the fixation I get is great, and I have a tendency to put something more to prevent potential failure of fixation.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Illiac Crest Bone Graft</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>My primary choice is still the illiac crest.  I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s the best thing or not, but especially in the upper extremity, there&#039;s no really great way to get a local bone graft, and I don&#039;t think of going through the femoral canal is any different than illiac crest.  Everybody has different experiences with the illiac crest bone grafting, and everybody has a different technique in his mind to do it.  So, everybody claims that they have less pain, or &ndash; it&#039;s a very tricky thing, quoting the numbers in the literature up to, like, 30-40 percent of problems.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Alternante Crest Technique</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>The numbers are huge in terms of pain after the illiac crest bone harvest.  One thing I&#039;ve done, based on some experience in fellowship, and also there&#039;s a paper on this, but I use the reamers and I go to the outer table.  And for whatever reason, anecdotally, the patients seem to be more comfortable; and I&#039;ve even had patients go home the same day, which usually what&#039;s keeping them in the hospital is the pain from the harvest site.  And I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s because you&#039;re coming on the outside of the illiac crest and not actually directly down on it, if there&#039;s less nerve endings or less dissection through the nerves at that level, but for whatever reason, it seems to be well tolerated, and you get a pretty good &ndash; a fair amount of bone graft using that technique.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Well, like Sean who&#039;s had an EMG, I&#039;ve had my crest taken, and it hurts like a son of a gun.  So, you know, I&#039;ve been there, felt it and you know, and that was before I was an orthopedic surgeon, and so, I had done crest grafts after that, but you know, we&#039;ve got a large obese population, and so that &ndash; to me, that&#039;s a big problem as well, because one, getting down there; two, they all tend to get hematomas and then infected.  And so, I try to avoid the illiac crest as much as possible.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Proximal Tibia Source</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p> So, what do you do for upper extremity?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I will tend to use proximal tibia if I really need a good amount and I really feel like I need to get it, if it&#039;s an atrophic non-union that I want to get good autogenous bone graft, I&#039;ll go to the proximal tibia.  Or if I need a lot, I&#039;ll go to the RIA and get it from the femoral canal as well.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Bone Graft Substitutes </font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Oftentimes, I&#039;ll just use some bone graft substitutes, whether it be DBX or other types of DBM materials, if it&#039;s small amounts that I need, and it seems to have worked for just the small areas.  But I haven&#039;t gone to the illiac crest in a long time.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>Do you think the de-mineralized bone matrix is really adding anything?  It seems kind of variable as a quality.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>It is very variable, and even &ndash; you know, there&#039;s one study from the ORS that showed that if you take all types that are on the market, they all have varying amounts of actual active material.  And so, it&#039;s a crap shoot, it really is.  Maybe it makes us feel better about putting something in there, but there&#039;s no good control studies to show that that works or not.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>It seems like even the same product from batch to batch has huge variability.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Absolutely, yes.  And it&#039;s amazing that there&#039;s no better stringent controls across the board on how much of certain substances you need to have in those materials to call it a DBM material or whatever.  And hopefully, we as a group will push for that kind of thing to happen, so that we do have standards and you can compare one to the other.  But, yes, there is way too much variability in all of those.</p><p><i><font size="-2">BMP&#039;s</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>What about the recombinant bone-morphogenic proteins?  Any role for those in your practice, or when do you use it?  When do you go to those?</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>For me, rarely.  It&#039;s usually in a fit of desperation, when I&#039;ve exhausted all other possibilities, or someone&#039;s had multiple previous bone grafts taken, and they&#039;ve &ndash; and they&#039;ve failed those.  But, yes, I tend not use it, and it mainly I think for cost issues, and I just don&#039;t think we know enough about them.  But, I think they&#039;re going to be defined a lot better in the future, and maybe for large segmental defects there&#039;ll be a definite role.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>When I feel like I&#039;ve done the right operation, and in my hands it still failed, that&#039;s sort of when I turn to those products.  It&#039;s just sort of desperation, isn&#039;t it?</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>Or, I mean, if the patient has had two operations before, and you think that when you evaluate the prior surgeries, they&#039;re adequate surgeries, and it&#039;s still not hypertrophic, non-union, I think it adds something else.

If a little distal, I go posterior.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>Do you posterior your triceps splitting, posterior triceps sparing?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Lateral Window</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>What I do a little differently.  I go around the triceps on the lateral side and proximally I split the triceps.  I don&#039;t split the whole triceps all the way down.  But, in that way I can get around distal fixation and proximal fixation, and I can work around underneath the radial nerve both ways.  You don&#039;t have to split all the way down, and you don&#039;t have to go both sides of the triceps, necessarily, neither.  I think it&#039;s less muscle damaging approach.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Triceps Sparing</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>So, you&#039;re working in a lateral window, inferiorally &ndash; </p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>Yes.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>And a triceps splitting window – </p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>In the mid-shaft level, around the radial nerve.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I tend to use the triceps sparing the entire length.  You know, that is actually one of the more influential articles ever read was the old Gerwin, Hotchkiss and Weiland article that really described that, that really convinced me that you could safely expose the humeral shaft over an incredible distance without splitting the triceps so, that tends to be the bridge I use for all mid and distal diaphyseal injuries.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Posterior Cutaneous Nerve</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>I&#039;ve been doing that, too.  I find it&#039;s nice, because especially in the setting of a radial nerve injury, you can find that posterior cutaneous branch on the lateral side and follow it to the nerve, and safely identify and get around the nerve without taking too much chance, leaving too much up to chance, which is nice.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Anterior Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Most of the ones I treat, you know, if they don&#039;t have the relative indications you talked about, the kind of long segments that you can anatomically reduce, straight-forward ones.  I&#039;ve been doing straight anterior approach.  Most of those patients are poly-trauma for me anyway, and I like to keep them supine, go straight anterior; done in 30-45 minutes, and get them in and out.  And so, most of the ones I&#039;ve been doing have been pretty much anterior.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Deltopectoral Approach</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>You can extend that into a deltopectoral proximally if they&#039;ve got extension up high, too, so I find that to be very useful for a lot of those fractures.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Mobilize</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I tend to let the vast majority weight-bear right away, especially if it&#039;s a simple fracture that&#039;s been compressed.  I&#039;d say the only exception would be, I guess, maybe in a comminuted fracture, or a fracture where I&#039;ve had to use a smaller implant than I would prefer because of the size of the bone.  Then I might limit their weight bearing.  But I think, to me, that&#039;s part of the reason that I fix a lot of humeral fractures, is to let them mobilize and weight bear.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Limit Torque</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>I do the same thing.  My only concern is some &ndash; and I think a lot of times, these plates, they&#039;re weakest sort of in torque.  And I&#039;ve had patients who don&#039;t follow &ndash; who aren&#039;t reliable, or don&#039;t really listen, and don&#039;t &ndash; they overdo it a little bit once they start feeling better, or they just ignore any kind of restrictions whatsoever.  And I&#039;ve had plates fail.  I&#039;ve had the screws break - the locked screws break at the plate/bone interface.  And I think it happens mostly in torque.  So, I try to limit them in torque a little bit.  I don&#039;t know if that really changes anything, but I do allow them to start using the arm in sort of the flexion/extension plane, and you know, for assisted gait and whatnot.</p><p><i><font size="-2">How Much Shortening</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>You mentioned the acute shortening, or the shortening after the non-union.  How much do the patients tolerate, cosmetically and in terms of function?</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>We don&#039;t tend to shorten them very much.  I mean, it&#039;s really just to give us a fresh bleeding surface of bone.  And so, we really just take off the atrophic cap, and make it either transverse or oblique. I don&#039;t know the answer to that.  I would never shorten someone more than three centimeters, or something like that.  It tends to be in the one to two centimeter range, or less.  So, yes I don&#039;t know.  It certainly does change the function of the extremity for a period of time, I think, until all the muscles that span that region shorten, but my just observation has been, these patients tend to do reasonably well.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"},{category:"Diaphyseal Fractures of the Humerus",title:"Pitfalls And Complications",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_05",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Minimally Invasive</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>There&#039;ve been a couple of papers out on using sort of a minimally invasive technique anteriorally, slide-in the plate sub-muscular through a small window down near the elbow.  Do you guys have any experience with that?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I don&#039;t.  That makes me nervous.  Maybe I&#039;m chicken about doing it.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I&#039;ve read some of the studies on it, too, and they seem like they&#039;ve got great results, but no, I have no experience with that.  It does scare me.</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>I have done just one, and it&#039;s the reduction maneuver, is really less limited this way.  I wasn&#039;t happy with the reduction, especially.  If you are operating on a patient and on a humerus fracture, I want to get a good reduction.  And if I struggle with the reduction because of the exposure, it&#039;s like compromising your goals.  It didn&#039;t really make too much sense to me.  So, I am not doing it, but there&#039;s an OTA.  There are two papers.  Two series.</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>I&#039;ve done a few of them now, and I find, you know, when they go well they go really well, and when they don&#039;t go well you&#039;re really struggling.  It&#039;s like, I might as well just open it all up, anyway.  But, the curious thing about it is, we talk so much about plating diaphyseal fractures and technique, and we talked a bit about compression plating for union.  And then, you go to this minimally invasive plate technique, and essentially, you&#039;re putting lock screws at either end of a plate with a long segment in between.  Often, these are simple transverse fractures.  You&#039;re not really getting much compression across them.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Relative Stability</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>You&#039;re really getting relative stability in a diaphyseal fracture that&#039;s short, transverse, and yet they seem to go on to heal.  It doesn&#039;t seem to follow the same principles that we see in the lower extremity where we really want to get compression.  And it&#039;s not really a weight-bearing bone as much as the lower extremity, either.  It still kind of works, sort of seems to violate some of our principles.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>But, you felt comfortable allowing them to use that arm to weight bear with that technique?</p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>Yes.  And I&#039;m doing it for very short, transverse, or oblique fractures where I really get the bone lined up, and for the most part I feel quite confident that I&#039;ve restored the axial stability to some extent by lining the bone up.  But, like I said, I&#039;ve only done a few.  I&#039;ve done five or six.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Radial Nerve Palsy Protocols</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>Provided we get to the point where we&#039;ve done this successful operation and everything&#039;s good, in the setting of the radial nerve palsy, what is your work-up for that, and when do you guys decide to intervene?</p><p>A preop radial nerve palsy, and they come back to your clinic, they haven&#039;t recovered yet.  At what point do you start doing further investigations?  Do you have a protocol that you follow, an algorithm?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>Not a clear protocol.  I think, in general, I give them a good three months.  And if I don&#039;t see any return at that point, I&#039;ll consider doing an EMG.  Although, I&#039;m not sure what the utility of it is, considering we&#039;ve been there, we&#039;ve looked at it, we know it&#039;s in continuity.  I don&#039;t know if &ndash; I&#039;m not one that does transfers in the upper extremity anyway, so I don&#039;t know if there&#039;s any benefit to getting that, really, when you know the nerve&#039;s at least in continuity, and you&#039;ve explored it.  I think it&#039;s more useful in the patients that you&#039;ve never operated on that have a radial nerve palsy and you really want to know what&#039;s going on with those.  So, but I usually give them three months, and right when I think I&#039;m going need to get an EMG, something starts coming back, and so I end-up not having to get it.</p><p><i><font size="-2">EMG</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>If I don&#039;t have any recovery, any kind of sensory or motor recovery, I get an EMG about six to eight weeks, to try to see if &ndash; depending on who&#039;s doing the EMG, if they &ndash; the question I&#039;m trying to ask, if there&#039;s any recovery, or if it&#039;s a total axial loss, because this is what we want to know; if the nerve is going to recover, or not.  And around six to eight weeks, depending on the literature, if you can do a good EMG you will have an idea.  Then, after &ndash; depending on the EMG results, if there&#039;s no recovery at all, I usually refer them for some kind of nerve repair grafting, or tendon transfers type of thing for upper extremity surgeon.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Establish Baseline</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>It&#039;s interesting.  I&#039;ve talked to some physiatrists who do a lot of EMG and nerve conduction studies, and some of them tell me as early as two weeks they can see &ndash; they can get some data that&#039;s useful.  They say before that it&#039;s a little bit ambiguous.  For me, I do get a baseline rather early, between four and six weeks, just to see where I&#039;m at if there&#039;s no clinical recovery.  Because, what I want to know &ndash; kind of what Utku addressed &ndash; I want to know is that nerve &ndash; we see it in continuity, but I want to know what&#039;s going on, on the inside.  And is there still some communication across there?  So, I get a baseline, so if they don&#039;t recover I can do a follow-up later, because it&#039;s a long way for the nerve to recover, and they may never get recovery of the distally innervated muscles.  But, it may still be months before they start to get any recovery of the proximally innervated muscles.  And I want to compare that progress to see where they&#039;re going.  Because, if they&#039;re not going anywhere, then I will go for an early tendon transfer and just get them back to function as soon as possible.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Early Tendon Transfer</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>How early will you make that decision?</p><p><i><font size="-2">Multiple EMG</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>I&#039;ll get the EMG between four and six weeks, and then I&#039;ll repeat it six week later and I&#039;ll compare the two.  If there&#039;s some kind of progression, then I&#039;ll keep watching it.  But, if there&#039;s no progression at that point, then I&#039;ll probably go &ndash; opt for early transfers.  I may be a bit aggressive about that, but I just don&#039;t see &ndash; usually, the majority of the ones that I&#039;ve seen, there&#039;s some sign of clinical or electrophysiological recovery by three months.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>And that&#039;s why I wait until three months, because at least, in my experience, I&#039;ve never had one that has not recovered at all, thank God.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I tend to wait a little bit, too, and mainly just because I&#039;ve had an EMG of my upper extremities, and it hurts.  And at least it&#039;s reasonably uncomfortable.  And so, I also kind of think about that for the patients, but I think your logic about &ndash; if you make an early decision by three months, by having two EMG&#039;s, that makes some sense as well.  I&#039;ve always tended to wait until three months and then refer as appropriate.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Non-Unions</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>I think you have to have a person doing the EMG who understands what you&#039;re looking for and communicates well with you, so that you&#039;re on the same page.</p><p>In these kinds of cases, what do you guys do when these fractures show-up as non-unions, whether they&#039;ve been operated on before or not?  Say one that&#039;s basically a virgin, no prior surgery, treated in a brace, goes on to a non-union mid-diaphyseal humerus.  Is your approach for a fixation, is it the same as it would for a primary fracture, or do you change something?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I primarily plate all those with or without bone graft, depending upon the type of biologic response they&#039;ve had up until that point.  Most of the ones I tend to see are more hypertrophic non-unions.  They&#039;ve been trying to heal.  There&#039;s some abundant callous in there, and I think it just needs good stability.  So, the majority I&#039;ve seen, I just treat with anterior plating and bone graft, if indicated.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Vitamin D Deficiency</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>What I have been doing, just kind of with some of the more recent literature that even came out of Houston from Ranker, but is really evaluating some of these patients for any other metabolic reasons why they haven&#039;t healed, you know, and looking at vitamin-D deficiency and things like that.  And we&#039;ve been doing that for most of our non-unions. And it&#039;s amazing how many people are vitamin-D deficient.  And whether it&#039;s really, truly the cause, or contributing to it, I feel better about at least trying to resolve some of that so they have the best chance of healing if I&#039;m going to operate on them.  So, but we&#039;ve been finding more and more abnormalities in those patients, but I treat them with plates, and like I said, bone grafting if needed.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_05.jpg",vidndx:"4"},{category:"Diaphyseal Fractures of the Humerus",title:"Avoiding Problems",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_06",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Nail Complications</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>Do you guys worry about &ndash; I mean, I don&#039;t &ndash; I know none of us here are really doing a lot of nailing, but do you worry at all about nailing these fractures when they&#039;re at or on the level with the radial nerve, and especially in the setting of a radial nerve palsy, or even an intact nerve?  Do you worry about that?</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I do.  That&#039;s why I don&#039;t nail. Most of the revisions I&#039;ve taken care of, or non-unions, have been ones that have been nailed, and I&#039;ve seen some disastrous results from nails.  And so I think, personally, I think the literature well documents that the complications from nails are a little bit greater than that of plates.  And so, I find it hard to justify doing a nail on certain fracture patterns that are completely amenable to a plate.  So, it makes me nervous because you never know.  You guys go in there and plate it, and sometimes you&#039;ll see that the nerve is just sitting right there, and let alone you stick a guide wire down there which goes through it, or &ndash; and then you start reaming.  So, yes, I get nervous.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Nail Pitfalls</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I agree with you.  I think it&#039;s really a mistake to do a nailing in a patient where you either &ndash; they&#039;re intubated and you don&#039;t know the status of their radial nerve, or they have a known nerve palsy, unless you make a small incision and explore the nerve, or somehow view the nerve and make sure that it&#039;s safe; or use some type of monitoring.  I think in those patients, you really can&#039;t safely assume that the nerve is not in the fracture, even though I think it&#039;s unlikely.  It would just be a horrible experience to have a patient have a nerve that actually got affected by nailing.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Postoperative Weight Bearing</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>In terms of your postoperative protocol, do you allow everyone to weight-bear right away?  Do you limit them in any way in their rehabilitation after plating?</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>I think I&#039;m a little more cautious than what the available literature suggests that you can weight-bear if you have a good bony contact and good reduction, you can let them weight-bear.  But, I still, at least for the first three to six weeks, I go progressively from kind of touch-down, to partial weight-bearing.  After six weeks, I let them weight-bear as tolerated.  But, I&#039;m a little more cautious, probably.  I haven&#039;t seen any problem with people doing weight bearing as tolerated.</p><p><b>Dr. Agarwal:</b></p><p>I let them weight-bear right away.  The only thing I probably do more to make myself feel better is I&#039;ll put them in a brace.  I&#039;ll put them in a Sarmiento on top of the fixation that whether they need to or not, I don&#039;t know.  I do that just probably more to make me feel better than anything else, but I let them weight-bear right away.</p><p><b>Dr. Kandemir:</b></p><p>I think I will agree that, in non-union cases, there&#039;s enough evidence that plates works better than other implants, especially the nails, in the case of a non-union, even if they haven&#039;t been operated on before.</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I may be a little more aggressive about doing kind of a very small primary shortening osteotomy on those to create a compressible surface on the virgin non-union.  In other words, a diaphyseal fracture that hasn&#039;t been treated operatively before that goes on to a non-union, especially if it&#039;s an atrophic non-union.  Then, I&#039;ll do just a very small resection of the bone ends just to create a compressible surface, and then plate it.  And we&#039;ve had great results with that technique.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_06.jpg",vidndx:"5"},{category:"Diaphyseal Fractures of the Humerus",title:"Things I Now Do Differently",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_07",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Longer Plates</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I tend to use much longer plates than I used to use.  Appreciating that I want, you know, a minimum of three screws on either side of the fracture, but that means, in a transverse fracture, it&#039;s not going to be a seven-hole 4.5-mm plate.  It&#039;s going to be a ten-hole 4.5-mm plate, but with three screws spread-out over a distance of five holes.  And I think that helps to protect from plate failure, because I do agree, I think the construct is going to be weakest in torsion.  So, that&#039;s why I&#039;ve gone with much, much longer plates.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Extensile Exposure</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>And that&#039;s why I do like an extensile exposure.  If it&#039;s proximal, if it&#039;s at the deltoid tuberosity or proximal, then I will do it through a deltopectoral extended into an anterolateral.  But, that&#039;s a very extensile exposure, and then a posterior triceps sparing exposure is very extensile.  So, I think it allows me to put on longer plates safely.</p><p><i><font size="-2">Illiac Crest Bone Graft</font></i></p><p><b>Dr. Sen:</b></p><p>What is your preferred source of bone graft, or substitute?</p><p><b>Dr. Nork:</b></p><p>I can tell you my &ndash; the source that I rarely ever use anymore, and that&#039;s the illiac crest.  I haven&#039;t been to the illiac crest in years.  And so, I&#039;ll either choose a local site, like the proximal tibia or the distal femur for lower extremities, or even for the upper extremity.  Or, I&#039;ll use the femoral intramedullary canal if I need a large quantity of bone.  Boy, I couldn&#039;t tell you the last time I went to the illiac crest, just because of patient discomfort issues.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1449A/M1449A_07.jpg",vidndx:"6"}]},discuss7:{data:[{category:"Two-Part Proximal Humerus Fracture 66 y/o Male",title:"Introduction",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1447A/M1447A_01",script:"<p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>We have assembled an expert panel here today to discuss some different factors involving treatment of proximal humeral fractures.

It looks like there&#039;s probably a fracture line that goes into the greater tuberosity.  But it&#039;s not significantly displaced.  Some medialization of the shaft. Kind of a common proximal humerus fracture from a low-energy type injury from a simple fall.

And so I&#039;ll use some fracture characteristics, combined with some patient characteristics, to make that decision.  This is a fellow in his mid-60&#039;s who, presumably, is active.  He used his upper extremities quite a bit.  He&#039;s a surgeon, and he&#039;s still actively involved in the management of patients.  That, combined with the fact that this is a very fixable fracture &ndash; I think this can be surgically stabilized, and this patient can be returned to function very rapidly.  Given the initial displacement of the fracture, I would lean towards operative treatment for this injury.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1447A/M1447A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"},{category:"Two-Part Proximal Humerus Fracture 66 y/o Male",title:"Reduction and Fixation Techniques",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1447A/M1447A_05",script:"<p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b></p><p>We elected for operative treatment.  And just a couple of fluoroscopy shots here will kind of show what we did.  And then I&#039;d be interested to go around the table and see other approaches to reduction.  So I guess getting into some of the specifics of reduction: we used sutures in both the supraspinatus and infraspinatus and subscapularis tendon.
