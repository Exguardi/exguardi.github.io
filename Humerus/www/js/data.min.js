And so throughout the '80's, when Hardegger first described his classification in, at that point, the largest operative series of scapula fractures on 37 patients, there's been a little bit more of a duel or controversy regarding whether they should be treated or whether they shouldn't. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_02.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Displacement",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_03",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Anatomical Displacement</font></i>  </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Part of the problem in discussing this clinical entity is that we don\'t have good ways of defining scapula anatomy, of measuring fracture displacement and angulation.  In the literature, you have many case series of both operative and non-operative cohorts, and they all have very loose definitions for displacement, and they include apples and oranges.  That includes process fractures, neck fractures, body fractures, intra-articular fractures. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Define Parameters</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>One of our keen initiatives at the University of Minnesota and Regions Hospital, with our Scapula Institute Initiative, is to start to define some of these parameters, so at the very least, we can start communicating appropriately as to what angulation means.  Does it mean version?  Does it mean angulation in the frontal plane, the coronal plane?  </p><p><i><font size="-2">Displacement Characteristics</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>What is medialization?  Does medialization occur?  It\'s really a displacement of the lateral border that we\'re talking about when we use the term "medialization."  But that\'s not clear from reading the literature.  Starting approximately 10 years ago, we developed a database of all our operative scapula fractures, and are starting to detail many of these things, including the functional outcomes, as well as motion and strength of patients that have been operated on.  </p><p><i><font size="-2">Basic Principles Apply</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So there\'s a growing acceptance for following basic principles of orthopedic trauma.  And that is a restoration of length, alignment, and rotation of the scapula in those that are severely displaced, as well as restoration of stability, so that you can promote early rehabilitation for the patient, which we hope will manifest in shorter loss of work times and quicker recovery times, back to a functional status, and, in fact, one in which a patient can reach their baseline. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Surgical Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_04",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Medialization</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So I\'ll start briefly with a description of what is most commonly cited in the literature as indications for operative treatment.  One is medialization.  And we understand that medialization doesn\'t necessarily mean medialization of the glenoid relative to the body or the midline of the patient, but medialization of the glenoid proximal fragment relative to the body distal fragment. </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So medialization indications for surgery range from the one centimeter that Miller and Ada detailed in an article from the 1980\'s, to up to two centimeters of medialization recently cited by a paper by Cliff Jones.  Authors fall in-between those two degrees of lateral border offset when they talk about indications for operative fixation. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Angulation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now another one is angulation.  And, typically, angulation refers to the angle of the proximal relative to the distal segment, as seen on a scapula Y view.  And then a third, commonly-cited indication for surgery is glenopolar angle, which is an angle formed by a line that goes from the bottom to the apex of the glenoid, and then from the apex of the glenoid to the inferior pole of the scapula. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Glenopolar Angle</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Because there have been some studies, such as those by Romero et al. and Bozkurt et al., which show poorer outcomes associated with glenopolar angles under twenty degrees.  So that\'s another type of angulation that we\'re keying in on.  Other operative indications include intra-articular step-off.  And some authors use two millimeters of step-off as the indication, and others use four millimeters of step-off, probably more commonly. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Glenoid Involvement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>It\'s also important to talk about the amount of glenoid involved.  And generally speaking, after approximately twenty-five percent of the glenoid is fractured and displaced, you begin to get instability of the glenohumeral joint, and that is an indication for surgery.  Said another way, if you have a fragment that is less than 25 percent of the joint, the glenohumeral joint is likely to maintain its stability, and, therefore, is not in need of surgical fixation. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Shoulder Suspensory Complex",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_05",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Superior Shoulder Suspensory Complex</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Another commonly-cited indication for surgery includes double lesions of the superior shoulder suspensory complex.  The superior shoulder suspensory complex is an anatomic entity described by Tom Goss from the University of Massachusetts, back in 1993, in which he talked about a ring of stability that goes from the glenoid neck to the coracoid, to the clavicle and acromion, through their respective ligaments. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Floating Shoulder</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>He stated that if someone had a lesion of two entities within that superior shoulder suspensory complex, then he coined the term "floating shoulder," which is an unstable glenohumeral joint, and the floating shoulder, he described as being another indication for surgery. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Glenoid Neck Fracture</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now there have been subsequent studies that argue exactly what constitutes a glenoid neck fracture, and how do you know that certain ligaments are torn?  But the bottom line is that the usual double lesion of the superior shoulder suspensory complex is either a clavicle fracture or an AC joint dislocation associated with a glenoid neck fracture.  If you have two of those that are displaced, then that is another indication for surgery of the scapula. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Fix Both Clavicle and Scapula?</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>There are proponents of fixing only the clavicle, and proponents of fixing both the clavicle and the scapula neck, and that\'s probably a higher-tier discussion for a different format, but that is certainly another operative indication.

That\'s certainly always the case in orthopedic trauma, but I think especially in an emerging field, in which it\'s not exactly clear which subset of patients we should be operating on. </p><p>I have operated on patients as – the oldest was a very bad glenoid neck and clavicle fracture in a 75-year-old patient.  But he still ran his own business, played eighteen holes of golf, at least a few times a week, and did a lot of work in the yard.  And so very much treated him like a younger patient, and he was back to his golf game at his baseline handicap by three months after surgery.  And that would not have occurred had we left the deformity that he had been injured with. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_06.jpg",vidndx:"5"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Surgical Approach",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_07",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Surgical Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So once you make the decision that a patient would be indicated for surgery, then it\'s probably reasonable to think about what approaches one should use.

If I restore all the fracture lines that exit that ring, then I am happy that the patient is appropriately stabilized, and can start to perform physical therapy and early range of motion on post-operative day number one.  So my goal is to restore, primarily, the lateral border and, secondarily, the ring that goes from the scapula neck, the acromion spine, the vertebral border. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Extensile Judet Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So that is done typically through an incision which is what we call a Judet incision.  This was described by Robert Judet in 1984, and he described an extensile approach in which one uses this boomerang-shaped incision along the posterior shoulder, to get down to the acromion spine, the vertebral border, and elevate the rotator cuff musculature, specifically the infraspinatus and teres minor. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Less Invasive Incision</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now there have been more limited approaches, still using a Judet incision, but using intermuscular intervals to get to the scapula neck, and to the perimeter of the scapular borders.  And this is what I would favor because it is less invasive.  It\'s less muscular dissection and elevation, and it\'s using intermuscular planes.  So it\'s, from a morbidity standpoint, very low morbidity.  </p><p><i><font size="-2">Teres Minor/Infraspinatus Interval</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>The intervals one would use, after raising a subcutaneous flap above the rotator cuff, would be, first, to cut the fascia along the inferior surface of the deltoid, elevate the deltoid, exposing the rotator cuff musculature interval between teres minor and infraspinatus, and using that interval to get right down to the lateral border of the scapula. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Rotator Cuff Elevation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>And then, when one wants to address a scapula spine fracture displacement or high superior angle on the vertebral border, or anywhere along the vertebral border, they can selectively elevate the fascia of the rotator cuff, at those intervals, to get down to the fracture where it\'s displaced.  That gives one control of the proximal and distal segments, or the glenoid and body segments of the scapula, to allow for clamp placement and reduction of the fracture, so that plates can be used.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_07.jpg",vidndx:"6"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Associated Injuries",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_08",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Associated Injuries</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now many times, scapula fractures are delayed in their presentation to surgery, because 95 percent of these patients have associated injuries with other organ systems, as well as an approximately 50 percent ipsilateral extremity injury rate, 30 percent neurovascular injury rate, 80 percent with thoracic multiple rib fractures, hemo and pneumothorax, and the like. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Late Presentation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So many times, patients are being stabilized in the intensive care unit, dealing with head injuries, and getting other long bones fixed.  And then the afterthought is that they present for Open Reduction Internal Fixation of the scapula, and that could be two, three, four weeks after the initial injury.  In those situations, the displacement has been long-standing.  Healing has started to occur, and it\'s difficult to accomplish a reduction. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Reduction Technique</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I find the most helpful way to affect a reduction, in those circumstances, is to put a Shanz pin in the scapula neck and a Shanz pin in the more distal lateral border, and then you have a joystick for the proximal and the distal segment to affect your reduction, especially at the lateral border.  Sometimes, I\'ll have an assistant hold that reduction while I apply a plate.  And then sometimes, I\'ll put in an actual small external fixator to hold the lateral border out to length for application of a plate. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_08.jpg",vidndx:"7"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Implant Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_09",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Implant Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>After one has obtained their reduction of the scapula neck and body, or the posterior glenoid, as the case may be, then the decision point is what implants to use.  The implants that would be used, that I favor, that have been applied in many cases with a very, very low failure rate would be 2.7 dynamic compression plates for the lateral border, and 2.7 recon plates for the scapula spine and vertebral border. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Locking Plates</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I have found that the locking implants are particularly useful in scapula surgery.  Because the screw lengths are so short.  So we\'re talking about eight to ten millimeter screw lengths for the vertebral border.  The acromion border may be in the range of twelve to sixteen millimeter screw lengths, and the lateral border – fourteen to sixteen millimeter screw lengths.  So given that the screw lengths are so short, and the deforming force is so high, the locking implants allow one to obtain greater stability with relatively shorter plates. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Longer Conventional Plates</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>If you don\'t use locking implants, then I would use the same-sized plates.  And yet, I would go to a much longer plate if I was using non-locking screws.  And I would put the alternating screws at different angles to obtain maximal fixation.  Posterior glenoid fractures, depending on the amount of comminution, are then really amenable to the use of T-plates, straight plates, whatever the fracture configuration warrants. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_09.jpg",vidndx:"8"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Patient Positioning",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_10",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Patient Positioning</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I operate on these patients in a lateral decubitus position, with a slightly floppy forward attitude of the patient.  And I happen to use the bone foam positioners, which support the involved extremity out in a forward-flexed, abducted position at approximately ninety degrees.  I prep the arm free, so that I can manipulate it and move it during the case. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Test Range of Motion</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>And then other considerations would be that after fixation of the scapula, I always do a manipulation of the shoulder.  Because in the intervening two, three, four, or five weeks since the time of injury, a patient can develop extrinsic contracture.  So always remember to finish your case with a nice full range of motion of the shoulder. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Stabilize the Rotator Cuff</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>In the cases in which I elevate fascia from , the scapula spine and the vertebral border, I like to repair that fascia through bone tunnels with heavy braided suture, thus ensuring the stability of the rotator cuff, so that we make sure that we\'re not going to present a risk for avulsion of the rotator cuff.  And then the rest of the interval is closed with sequentially #1.0, 2.0 braided suture.  Then, finally, I use a 3.0 absorbable, subcuticular stitch. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_10.jpg",vidndx:"9"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Surgical Approach Variations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_11",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Straight Posterior Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Variations on the approach then can certainly occur.  If the fracture is isolated to the real scapular neck or anatomic neck or to the posterior glenoid, you don\'t need to use a Judet incision.  You can use a straight posterior approach.  This was described by Brodsky, and it\'s the same muscular interval I just described – elevating the deltoid out of the way, and going down between teres minor and infraspinatus. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Anterior Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>But the difference is that you\'re using a smaller, straight, posterior incision centered over the glenoid, roughly in line with the fibers of the rotator cuff.  The only time that I use an anterior approach for scapula fractures, and specifically a deltopectoral approach, is for intra-articular fractures that involve the anterior glenoid, comminuted glenoid fractures in which I can\'t get to all the articular reduction from the back, cases in which there\'s a superior glenoid fracture – a so-called Ideberg III classification, where the superior glenoid is displaced medially, commonly. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Coracoid Access</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Frequently, the fracture exits below the coracoid.  That\'s a very difficult fracture to treat, and that warrants an anterior approach.  And in that case, you get down in the deltopectoral interval.  You take down the subscapularis, leave a cuff of tissue on the lesser tuberosity, do a capsulotomy, as necessary, to see your articular reduction, and then plates are what I prefer for the anterior glenoid, as necessary, depending on the size of the fragments. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Coracoid Fixation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>If a coracoid is fractured, I\'ll typically use 2.7 millimeter screws.  And I like to use at least two screws, going into the coracoid, in order to get rotational control of that bone. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Process Fractures</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Process fractures, specifically, are indicated for surgery if the coracoid is displaced – in my mind – more than 9 millimeters, or more than a centimeter, and then also if an acromion fracture is displaced any more than 0.5 centimeters. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Acromion Fractures</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I think there\'s less forgiveness in the acromion because of the potential secondary impingement which can occur if that acromion tips and encroaches on the outlet for the supraspinatus and rotator cuff tendon. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Isolated Coracoid Process Fracture</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So in the case of the isolated process fractures, which actually occur very uncommonly, the operative indications would be more than a centimeter displacement of the coracoid, and more than a centimeter of displacement for the acromion; keeping in mind, of course, that there\'s no good data to stratify functional outcome associated with certain amounts of displacement of those fractures. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_11.jpg",vidndx:"10"},{category:"Current Perspectives on Scapula Fractures",title:"Post-op Protocol",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1699A/M1699A_12",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Postop Protocol</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>The postoperative rehabilitation after Open Reduction Internal Fixation is really quite simple.  I render the fracture stable, and so they go through immediate passive and active range of motion with physical therapy.  That goes on for a month.  At one month, I begin a strengthening program, starting with one to two pounds of weight, and gradually increase the weight until they are removed to restrictions at three months. </p><p>And at that point, I have not seen problems being overly aggressive with that rehab program, and patients are generally back to baseline by three months, understanding that they have to build endurance over the ensuing months.

I certainly remember being a resident and being told that one in one hundred clavicles ever had a problem and the only reason they did is because you operated on them.  It was just heresy to operate. </p><p>I think there was some very important early work coming out of Toronto that took patients who had a clavicle treated non-operatively, had healed, apparently what we called healed, radiographic healing, and brought them back and tested those people and began to find very specific deficits; deficits with overhead movement, particularly repetitive overhead movement.  And that's not just an athlete.  That's someone who works in a factory who is lifting things over their head.  That's an awful lot of our workforce. </p><p>And from that I think evolved some real quality clinical work.  And I think that the clavicle may have some of our best randomized-control trials that answers questions we'd like answered for every bone in the body that really said is operative and non-operative management comparable, and which is better.   And I think that there's some quite compelling, well-researched evidence that says, in a certain group of patients, certainly of those with comminution, those in whom the clavicle has displaced a clavicular width, has bayoneted essentially, that those patients really are better served with an operative management.  And that's something that I still discuss in a lot of detail with my patients.  It's lovely when this is a patient who will participate as a decision-maker.  I sometimes photocopy articles for a lot of these patients.  I often give them one or two days to think about this because it is a newer area, and I think if they're reading old things on the Internet, they're going to get some questions. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Clavicle Fracture Surgical Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>So similar to what Rena just alluded to, using the Robinson criteria a little bit for nonunion of older age and female comminution and displacement are kind of the first things we screen for in order to really have a discussion with the patient.  I think it's important what Rena alluded to, as well, is it really becomes a discussion of presenting them so we know now that there's a fifteen percent nonunion rate with non-operative treatment.  Still, eighty-five percent heal and maybe some subtle weakness with overhead activity and definitely a malunion if it heals, so some patients are willing to accept that and some aren't. </p><p>So I think, like you said, patient selection and patient discussion is a critical part of it.  And usually it's when one or two of those criteria are met, we start having that discussion with patients and start recommending operative treatment and really presenting them with the facts and kind of coaching them along to make a decision on what they want to do. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Extra-articular Fractures</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>In terms of surgery on the scapula fracture, are you treating extra articular fractures then?  I've heard the glenoid mentioned twice.  If it's a displaced, articular fracture certainly it falls within the foundational principles of orthopedic trauma that you try to render the joint anatomic. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Lateral Displacement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>Yes.  We've been looking at displacement on the lateral border and I'd be interested to hear your approach on these, as well.  But, yes, the threshold, the amount of displacement that's acceptable isn't clear to me and maybe you'll have some more insight into that.  Certainly you're looking at declination of the glenoid and you mentioned the glenoid polar angle, and that certainly weighs into the equation in terms of operative indications.  But what's your approach when you see an acute, extra-articular scapula fracture? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Relevant Surgical Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I regard all the indications in my mind as being relative and that's because you don't have great evidence.  But I use a lot of deductive reasoning from what we know about other fractures to understand that, at some point, there's some level of deformity that must be deleterious.  It would not be logical to say that they all do fine when every other single bone in the body we don't tolerate the type of sub placement we talk about in scapulas such as forty-five degrees of angulation or a centimeter of displacement. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Medial Displacement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I actually have a higher threshold for the so-called medialization and I use fifteen to twenty millimeters of displacement.  But typically, that's occurring at the same time as some degree of angular deformity.  So we presented a paper at this meeting comparing three observers reading X-rays and three observers reading 3-D CT scans and which you can rotate in the perfect AP and the perfect scapula-Y, and we measure translation and angular deformity, medialization and gleno-polar angle and the inter and intra-observer correlation is extremely high with reading 3-D CT scans typically good or excellent, which is unusual for orthopedic trauma. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Surgical Parameters</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So that's a start, both in helping to define indications and correlate certain displacements with certain outcomes, and perhaps even some of the work we do on classification of fractures, but those are the parameters I'm looking at.  Again, thirty degrees of angular deformity, two centimeters of medialization, gleno-polar angle less than twenty-five degrees I start to get quite worried.  If you tip the gleno-humeral joint down, that's the amount they're going to lose in forward flexion.  It's just a fact.  You change their arc of motion to some other place in the shoulder girdle and it so happens that we don't use a lot of shoulder extension to make up for the shortening of forward flexion that we lose if the gleno-polar angle is decreased. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_02.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Shoulder Girdle Fractures",title:"Pitfalls and Complications",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_03",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Supraclavicular Nerve Issues</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now, let me ask you a question about identifying the supraclavicular nerves.  Do you do that?  Is it important? </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>Yes, I was going to ask that as well.  I start out dissecting, but I found that sometimes, there are large, supraclavicular nerve branches.  I've had a few patients who had some nerve branches inadvertently cut who had pretty painful neuromas.  And so some are certainly thicker than others. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Identifying the Supraclavicular Nerve</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>We found some smaller ones that you know other times those get cut and those don't seem to be a problem.  And then you go slowly, and you find the bigger ones. </p><p>So I start out looking for them.  I'm not sure how important they end up being.  People definitely have a patch of numbness when they get cut, and how bothersome that is isn't clear to me either.  It doesn't seem like it bothers most people.  But how about you? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I think I'm very much the same.  I don't think I find them with the success that you do.  I always say to the residents, \"you're supposed to look for these,\" and after about five minutes, we sometimes abandon the search, I'm afraid. </p><p>I certainly have learned to warn patients about that numbness inferior to the incision.  I think as surgeons, we don't think of numbness as a big deal.  It's not infection.  Everything's healed well.  We've got a lovely X-ray.  The shoulder moves.  Who cares if there's a numb patch? </p><p>It's something very abnormal to patients and it's distressing to them because of that, even though we know you don't put your shoulder near the stove and burn it.  And I find just giving the patients the warning preoperatively decreases their anxiety over why is this not normal after surgery. </p><p>I would say I find the branches one in ten times.  I go looking, but I may not be looking in the right places, but I'm not finding them. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Neuromas</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Yes, I would say that first of all I have not seen a painful neuroma.  I do try to identify it when I can and there are clearly times when I'm not successful.  I know other colleagues that are very reputable trauma surgeons who laugh at the thought of trying to identify the nerve and I have not seen it to be a widespread problem.  Other than the numbness and patient expectation is absolutely the key to success in terms of managing a postoperative numbness with a reasonable patient satisfaction. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Progressive Displacement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I'm glad you made the comment about the progressive displacement that absolutely occurs.  We've had two papers recently accepted.  They're not published yet.  This is Journal of Trauma. </p><p>One for the scapula and one for the clavicle, which follows a group of patients over the first three weeks and shows progressive medialization, bayoneting, angulation of the clavicle, and then, in the case of the scapula, a worsening of the glenopolar angle. </p><p>I think when you have especially multiple injuries around the shoulder girdle superimposed on a thorax, which is crushed in, with, let's say, a half-dozen or more rib fractures, there's very little place for that to go once the patient is up and dependency and gravity start to work on the shoulder girdle, which causes sometimes a very grotesque drooping pattern of the fore quarter. </p><p>So I think, therefore, that it's not wise to declare someone a non-operative clavicle fracture and have him follow up in four to six weeks, because you're not going to do anything for them.  They may displace in the first week or two. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Acute Associated Injuries</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Like many patients with scapula fractures that are referred in from St. Elsewhere, they are getting their femurs fixed and they're in the intensive care unit for a period of time.  They've got traumatic brain injury, and not infrequently, we're operating at three, four, five, six weeks out from the time of their initial injury because that's when they finally make it to you. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Delayed Complications</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Sometimes they've seen two or three surgeons that have said, \"You don't need your scapula fixed.\"  But the patient knows that their shoulder is not right and they keep finding a surgeon who might consider operating.  So those cases I think are difficult to do through the modified approach, as you said. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Open Procedure</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Absolutely.  And I think this is a fracture that is particularly difficult delayed.  It's a very well-vascularized area.  They have an enormous amount of callous.  I've found as early as ten days, they do bleed a lot as you begin to remove all of that callous, they're not on tourniquet.  So I frequently delay because my trauma team may say, \"Well, is this a little surgery like a clavicle?\" </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Blood Loss Potential</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>And I say, \"Oh, no.\"  First of all, we're going in a lateral position.  We're going to be perhaps several hours.  We're going to have possibly a significant blood loss and especially when you get into those big, muscular male patients who are workers or farmers that have slab muscle that's four inches thick before you can get down to the scapula, those guys can drop a liter.  And they're pretty sick ICU patients. </p><p>Frequently the trauma team will say, \"Well, this isn't a limb-threatening injury and they're still quite sick.  We'd like you to delay.\"  I really like to get at these no later than five days in my perfect world.  But you're absolutely right.  They come to you via a long chain of delays and they do need a wide-open approach, I agree. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Associated Suprascapular Nerve Injuries</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>And these patients that are referred in later, who are potentially a little further out of the acute phase, are you seeing any clear kind of suprascapular nerve injuries? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">EMG/Nerve Conduction Study</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I'm glad you asked that.  I've got an EMG/nerve conduction study on all patients that present after two weeks and we have a paper in review now where we looked at a couple of things.  One is the integrity of the suprascapular nerve by this test, the EMG/nerve conduction study, as well as intra-operative inspection and then post-operative physical examination. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">\"True\" Scapular Neck Injuries</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>One of the things that we've learned that I think is very important is the fractures, the so-called true neck fractures which extend up into the spino-glenoid notch at the base of the acromion, there is between a thirty and forty-percent incidence of injury rate to that nerve.  And frequently in those patterns when you start to dissect in that area and take away the callous, you'll see the nerve either trapped or sometimes completely lacerated by the fracture. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Suprascapular Nerve Entrapment</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I have beautiful pictures of that and plenty of cases so there's a roughly thirty-three percent suprascapular nerve injury in the fractures that go up into the spino-glenoid notch.  And we have an update on those delayed cases with EMG/nerve conduction studies that we know that's happening preoperatively.  So that's a time to be aware of that injury. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Suprascapular Nerve Lesions</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>What's also fascinating is that patients, even who have complete suprascapular nerve lesions, don't seem to miss their suprascapular nerve because they can have complete atrophy in the normal DASH score or function, and other than the external rotation range of motion and strength, they have everything else normal and have compensated wonderfully, and so they are not associated with worse outcomes. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Restore Nerve Position</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>This is really fascinating to me and it means, therefore, that the question would be, what do you do if you encounter that?  I have always carefully tacked the nerve back to its destination on the under surface of the infraspinatus, as best I can.  I have seen regeneration or I should better express reinnervation by virtue of patient's function and EMG results over time in young patients.  And I'm talking about the late teens. </p><p>So there may be some value to doing that.  But advanced muscle transfers or nerve grafting, I do not think we will find that is indicated. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_03.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Shoulder Girdle Fractures",title:"Avoiding Problems",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_04",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Distal Clavicle</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>How about distal clavicle fractures?  There's certainly a spectrum of injuries in the distal clavicle injury.  What is your approach to that in general?  Let's separate that from the AC dislocation. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Non-union Rate</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>Certainly there's a high nonunion rate in the distal clavicle so I typically have a lower threshold to recommending fixation for these type of injuries.  The ideal fixation is to use the hook plate, which I have a fair amount of times.  It seems like it always needs to come out, and I think it should always come out.  It's pretty prominent in the subacromial space and there are a few patients with  a periarticular  kind of pre-contoured plates and many points of locked fixation laterally and plated superiorly across the joint and then taking it out later, and that seems to work as well. </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b>  </p><p>Very similar and I certainly have a little different discussion with those patients exactly as Mike said.  This is a significantly more problematic fracture than a mid-shaft for a non-union particularly. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Clavicle Plate Issues</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I have also used a hook plate.  I agree with everything you said about taking it out.  I've tried some of the superior plates that have the more broad foot plate with the multipoints.  I've had two of them fail and I think part of that is these were both in patients with sub-optimal bone and I think, Peter, your earlier comments about the type of bone that makes a big difference. </p><p>That young athlete who breaks a bone off their bike, it's very different than the older, perhaps alcoholic, malnourished. For whatever reason, the bone is poor quality and even though I've got four points of fixation, by the time you come out to that far lateral clavicle, that is a really thin bone from superior to inferior.  It's perhaps eight millimeters at best. </p><p>So, yes, you've got a lot of points but they're very small.  The legs of the stool are very small and I've had two of those pull out.  I've really gone back to the hook plate, as invasive as it may be, and it does need another operation.  But when these two failed, that meant another operation, so it's kind of my \"go-to.\" </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Surgical Benefits</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>And, I don't think that we can minimize the pain-relieving power of an operative intervention on the clavicle.  There are certainly people who come back and we've discussed it and they said, \"I think we'll go non-op,\" and they'll come back in a week just saying, \"Do something.  I really can't stand this.\"  And they're really quite miraculously  better after they've got their solid plate in them and exactly as you described, when you've got a scapular injury and a significant thorax injury, getting that clavicle plated in that multi-trauma patient is just one more way to improve their pulmonary toilette and they can take a big, deep breath without the clavicle hurting.  Certainly, we've done that for what is perhaps only a soft indication, but there's no question that someone feels dramatically better, almost waking up in the recovery room with either their scapula or their clavicle plated, which amazes me that the scapula with such an invasive procedure and yet they're almost instantly better pain-wise the next morning certainly. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Suprascapular Nerve and Artery</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>How do you address or care for the suprascapular nerve and artery?  That could be a big deal.  We haven't completely learned whether or not we're adding insult to the injury.  Talk about that nerve and artery. </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>It's funny.  I've got a palsy recently that one of the things I find difficult is in the very sick patient, the ICU patient, or they're in so much pain, a really good preoperative neurological examination is not always possible.  And I emphasize to the residents that I don't really want to see a chart that says neurovascular, \"check\".  And then afterwards, there's perhaps some subtle problem. </p><p>I also think there are patients, particularly based on mechanism, someone who's been ejected and has some of this injury from driving the shoulder down.  We used to see it in Canada with the snowmobiles that I'm sure you still see.  We don't see a lot of that in Alabama but with motorcycles. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Brachioplexus Risk</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Those people are a really high risk for a brachioplexus and in the intubated patient, you don't know, and some of the others you really can't do a good exam.  I think you're right that we may be the second hit to a nerve that we can't really tell is injured.  That patient can't do a lot of those things for you preoperatively. </p><p>I think it's more of a risk the bigger and the more muscular the patient is.  You're just going to do that much more retracting.  Certainly when I'm working, I will identify the nerve, and then, it's like the ulnar nerve.  You've identified it to protect it and yet you've stripped blood supply while you were identifying it and I think that's a \"rock and a hard place.\"  I'm not satisfied not knowing where it is when I'm having to work up high and yet I don't know if I'm doing more harm.  I think that's a very good point. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Aggressive Postoperative Regimen</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Great.  Any last thoughts on the scapula or clavicle? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Only a point that you touched on, Peter, about the aggressiveness of your post-operative regime.  I think that perhaps that and fractures of the elbow are the two places that will absolutely undo your work if this patient goes home and is lost to follow-up for two or three weeks.  I think that there is still reluctance on the part of some therapists to do passive and even to teach the patients active-assisted.  They'll come back and all they'll be doing is a little bit of active, and that's 20 degrees of forward motion, and then you're on your way almost to a frozen shoulder. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">ADL Therapy</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>So I'm like you.  I do it in the OR so that I feel confident doing it the next day on the floor, and really have them doing a lot of ADLs.  Make sure the family is well educated.  It's not like a tibia.  This can go wrong if everyone doesn't understand.  You can't do much wrong with the tibia.  Family and patient really need a sophisticated understanding of the needs of rehab.  And if they don't have the resources as some of our trauma patients don't, how can they do good home exercises, make a home pulley and things like that? </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_04.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Shoulder Girdle Fractures",title:"Technical Concerns",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_05",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Technical Concerns</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now, are you \"platers\" or \"nailers\" for clavicle fractures?  Dr. Stewart? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Well, I would like to be a \"nailer,\" and I really think that there's a clavicle out there somewhere that would be wonderfully treated with it, but I just don't seem to ever have them come through my door.  I think that the mid-shaft, transverse fracture in someone who has a relatively large medullary canal is probably optimally treated with, if not a nail, a screw; something intermedullary. </p><p>I just see so few of those.  I tend to see things that are comminuted or they're oblique and my residents joke that it's not a sunny day if we haven't had an intermedullary device talked about, but we never put them in.  We always pull it and it's never the right fracture. </p><p>I'm a big fan, interfragmentary screws and then I plate virtually everything. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Nails</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>I actually lean towards nailing a little bit and the medial entry titanium nail actually seems like it works very well.  I agree the fracture pattern needs to be appropriate; typically the non-comminuted transverse mid-shaft.  There's a recent, randomized study, as you both know, that found Type ‘C\" fractures nailed were still better than non-operative, they shortened a little bit, hardware was prominent, but it still seems right. </p><p>So I don't typically nail comminuted fractures.  I still get, I agree, screws a lot and an anterior, inferior plate.  How about you, Peter?  What are your thoughts on fixation or indications as well? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Plate Position</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I also prefer plating and there are times when I use a cephalad-placed plate and other times when I use an anterior plate.  Generally, I like the anterior, inferior position for the reason of being less prominent.  That being stated, I think that manufacturers are becoming better with their pre-contour designs, number one, which make superior plating better.  And then, number two, there are fractures that I think are particularly unstable because of the zone of comminution, or perhaps the size of the patient or my perception of the compliance of the patient where I would prefer to opt for the superior position, which I believe to be more biomechanically stable on the tension side of the cortex. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Minimally Invasive</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So, I'm a \"plater.\"  I must say I have not pinned any clavicular fractures.  I have done some minimally-invasive plating, however, of mid-shaft clavicle fractures with small incisions on either end.  That's unpublished data, but I'm starting to favor the trend toward minimally-invasive approaches. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Locked Plate Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>You mentioned locked plates.  I guess it was just a matter of time before something about locked plates came up.  So in your practice, which patients and which fracture patterns of the clavicle are you going to lock plate? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>For me, in general, it's someone who is highly comminuted, where I'm worried about compliance, exactly as Peter said, where I have a long span of comminution, where I'm going to be three or four screw holes over the comminution.  Those are the patients.  If I've got an oblique fracture and I can get a good \"interfrag\" in it, I'm still using a good old, garden-variety, 2.7 recon plate because I can make a perfect contour, get it way down anteroinferior as you said Peter, and it is well buried and that plate has all the strength I need, except in those special circumstances. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Bridging vs. Stable Fixation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>How about you, Peter?  What do you say?  Locked plates for clavicle? </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I would answer it the same way.  If I can get in young, hard bone, direct apposition of fractures where I'm relying on primary fracture healing, a non-locked plate is certainly sufficient.  On the other hand, if I'm using more of a bridging construct and/or I have a patient I know is going to push it hard postoperatively, I'll have a much lower threshold to use a locked plate. </p><p>Now, let me ask you a question about identifying the supraclavicular nerves.  Do you do that?  Is it important? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Supraclavicular Nerve</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>Yes.  We've had some scapular thoracic disassociations where we've actually kind of put that anterior plate on, but changed the contour to extend laterally, and then so you get kind of the parallel screws that go deep.  It's a rare circumstance and you certainly need to take down more deltoid than you're probably comfortable doing and it's not an ideal solution for it. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Crossing the AC Joint</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b>  </p><p>You're suggesting take the plate out over the AC joint and put some of the screws out into the acromion. </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b>  </p><p>Right. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Hook Plate</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I have done that on a couple of ocassions.  I think if I'm going to be that invasive, I'd almost rather go with the hook plate.  I've never, perhaps I'm lucky enough, had the hook plate come out. </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I also have used that extensively and I would say that I tried many things before the hook plate and always with some significant percentage of failure; specifically pins across the AC joint, the so-called Bosworth screws, other techniques, the supplementation of tendon or a Weaver-Dunn modified procedure to supplement, say, a distal clavicle resection. </p><p>And the hook plate is a powerful device.  And I just prepare the patients to have it taken out in three months and I have not seen any displacement either, as long as I leave them in for three months, either for AC dislocations or for distal clavicle fractures. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Floating Shoulder</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>I totally agree.  Back to just the general, and we may cover it a bit later, but general indications for treating clavicle fractures, do you think that an ipsilateral injury to the glenoid, the so-called floating shoulder, do you think that leads you to fix the clavicle fracture? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Displacement Criteria</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>My own indication for surgery on those is when both the scapula and clavicle lesion are displaced.  So if they're both minimally displaced, say less than a centimeter, I would certainly watch those, with my reasoning being that if the clavicle heals where it is and the scapula heals where it is, there's no reason to think that the patient wouldn't do great. </p><p>But that's less displacement than I would, say, tolerate for an isolated scapula fracture or an isolated clavicle fracture, so my threshold is lower but not automatic. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Late Displacement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I think that's true.  I've had a few fairly late displacements of what began as minimally-displaced clavicles in the multi-trauma patient.  And I think a lot of those patients are intubated, being moved by nurses and heaved up in bed.  They're flailing around often as they're recovering from a head injury.  They're sometimes restrained while they're flailing. </p><p>They're doing things that an otherwise healthy 21-year-old cyclist isn't doing to their clavicle and I've learned to watch those a little more closely with almost a weekly X-ray and I've certainly done some intervention on – if it was an isolated clavicle I might not have, simply because they were polytrauma trauma whether or not it's actually a \"Floating Shoulder\" and, absolutely agree with what Peter said, if it's significantly displaced and the clavicle is an easy shot.  Sometimes I'm going to be doing the scapula anyway because of the pattern, or there's an intra-articular component, to that I've got to do the scapula.  Do I then need to do the clavicle?  And we sometimes play that \"by ear\" because I don't think that there's any hard and fast rules.  But my threshold for that is certainly lower.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_05.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"Shoulder Girdle Fractures",title:"Things I Now Do Differently",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_06",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Minimally Invasive Clavicle Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Your comment about the minimally invasive, I think in the clavicle, is not so much that we have a healing problem.  I think with good interfragmentary compression, most of these heal well.  But it's an unattractive scar.  And especially – I make the biased, perhaps I was going to say in my young ladies - I guess I should talk to men about aesthetics just as much.  But it is a prominent scar.  Living in the South as I do, young ladies do wear strapless gowns and very small sleeves on the blouses and it's a big scar, particularly if someone shows some tendencies towards hypertrophic scarring or, heaven forbid, keloids.  I think you need to have that discussion that the standard incision doesn't lie in Langer's Lines, and it's wide. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Postoperative Protocol</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Peter, do you change your postoperative rehab and what you allow the patients to do?  I am more conservative with my far distals.  I think one of the failures, I may have just gotten the patient going too much, too fast.  I'm very aggressive with my mid-shaft clavicles, exactly as you said Peter. I've got that good interfragmentary compression.  I'm very happy to let those people be very active very early, but I'm much more conservative with my distals.  Do you reflect that? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Hook Plate Symptoms</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Yes, I would say that I just don't push them as hard.  And the reason is because a substantial percentage of them are symptomatic and the symptoms resolve when the hook plate comes out.  So there is some sort of impingement that goes on with it and certainly the problem of osteolysis is well described. </p><p>But what I'm puzzled by is why some patients don't have any symptoms.  In fact, there are patients that have not wanted to have the implants taken out because they're asymptomatic.  But I don't think that's the more common scenario. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Scapula Fracture</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Are you treating scapula fractures in your practice at all, Dr. Stewart? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Certainly.  I'm probably doing one a month, probably two a month in trauma season.  I have a very wide referral base in Alabama.  I'm seeing most of the state, so I'm getting a very large pool to draw from and people know that I have an interest so it's a skewed number.  Again, that's very different than my practice perhaps five years ago. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Scapula Surgical Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Gardner:</b> </p><p>Yes.  I'd say it's still pretty infrequent that we see an operatively indicated scapula.  But I think the historical surgical nihilism is certainly changing and the adage that the scapula heals well so it doesn't need surgery has only changed and our thresholds are definitely lower.  So when we see over a centimeter displacement at the neck or at the body, and certainly inter-articular involvement, yes, we're treating these with surgery. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Extra-articular Scapula Fractures</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>What about extra-articular fractures? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I am, Peter, certainly increasingly.  Again the shortening more than a centimeter is our general criteria.  Also, if we're looking at a floating shoulder trying to assess which of the scapula and clavicle can perhaps render the shoulder anatomically normal or close more easily. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">3D Imaging </font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I think that good three-dimensional imaging is helping us. It's one of the places that I really like three-dimensional reconstructive scans.  I think we learn a lot from them because it's hard to see on a plane X-ray, and perhaps having those images has allowed me to understand the fracture a little bit better.  But I would say, perhaps a third of what I do are purely extra-articular. </p><p>And these are inevitably people who have a very significant thoracic injury, as well, and they have all their ribs caved in on that side, as well.  And there is a significant benefit I think to getting that stable, being able to get it moving, decreasing pain and bringing them back to a near-normal anatomy in terms of recreating the distance from the midline out.  The muscle is tensioned at that distance; not caved in an inch.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1539A/M1539A_06.jpg",vidndx:"0"}]},discuss3:{data:[{category:"MVA Associated C-Spine Injury w/ No Neurologic Deficit 45 y/o Male",title:"Scapula Fracture",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_01",script:'<p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>The first three images are from a patient who is three weeks after a motor vehicle collision, during which time he sustained this scapula fracture associated with a cervical spine injury, with no neurologic deficit.  The right lower-hand film is an AP of the shoulder with some hardware, which is reflective of the halo vest which he is now in.  He\'s a 45-year-old patient who is right-hand dominant. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Fracture Assessment</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Again, no neurologic deficit.  His lifestyle is one that\'s generally quite active.  He likes outdoor activities, such as canoeing, and plays occasional tennis – is married, has three children.  And he works as a sales consultant. </p><p>So based on these images, which really reflect 3D CT scan rotated to an AP view of the glenohumeral joint and scapula, as well as a 3D CT scan rotated to a view, which corresponds with a scapula Y, parallel to the plane of the scapula.  What would be your considerations in this particular case, Dr. Stewart? </p><p><i><font size="-2">3 Weeks Post Injury</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Well, first of all, I think that the fact that he\'s three weeks out is going to significantly increase the difficulty.  I find in the scapula, in particular, being such a well vascularized area, with so much muscle, this is a fracture that the more delay there is, the more difficult things are.  That\'s my first concern. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Halo Restrictions</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>The fact that he\'s in a halo is going to make this tremendously more difficult.  I generally do these in a lateral position. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Spine Stability </font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>And I don\'t know if I can speak with my spine colleagues to say: is his spine going to be completely safe and stable?  While I\'ve got the patient in my standard position, I may have to think about adjusting positions. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Surgical Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So you are speaking as though he has indications for surgery, in your mind? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Yes.  I would love to be able to spin the CTs around.  But to me, he\'s got adequate displacement.  His angle – his glenopolar angle looks to be an operative criterion, in my eyes.  So were this simply a two-day old fracture, with none of the complicating factors, my answer is yes. I may have to modify that answer, based on some of those other complicating things.</p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_01.jpg",vidndx:"0"},{category:"MVA Associated C-Spine Injury w/ No Neurologic Deficit 45 y/o Male",title:"Associated Injuries",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_02",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Associated Clavicle Fracture</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>If we look at the AP of the shoulder, we see that the clavicle is also fractured and displaced.  What implications does that have for you, Dr. Ring, in this case? </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>It adds to the shoulder girdle injury.  And people talked about whether having a double disruption – second disruption – so something on the scapular glenoid neck side and something on the clavicle side – would increase the problems. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Double Disruption Issues</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>And, conceptually, that makes a lot of sense.  As with much of this, we only have case series to go by, which is not helpful for distinguishing which might be superior.  But it certainly adds to the instability and potential deformity.  There are several case series that say it doesn't make too much difference. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">3 Week Assessment</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>And I think it's hard to know, in this area, because the shoulder girdle is so forgiving.  I liked your comments about the fact that it's three weeks old.  Three weeks old for a clavicle is not so much.  You'd still be hurting on that.  But if it was just the scapula, you'd probably be pretty well healed. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Functional Assessment</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>In fact, you can start to see how somebody's going to do.  You can have them range their shoulder, and see what they're doing, in terms of function and range of motion.  No matter what the alignment is, there is sort of a secondary congruity. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Secondary Congruity</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>There's no instability to the glenoid.  You're not going have any major problems, like dislocation of the superior glenohumeral joint, that I think everyone would agree would need surgery.  And it's hard to tell what the scapular body deformity is, in terms of potential scapular thoracic crepitation or pain. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Added Clavicle Consideration</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>But that would be another concern.  Those are some things that would almost cause problems in anybody, and would be a little bit easier trigger to operate.  But at three weeks, it's large – that part starts to heal.  Adding the clavicle fracture in – I think that's one more thing on the side of operating.  But there's still room for opinion. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_02.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"MVA Associated C-Spine Injury w/ No Neurologic Deficit 45 y/o Male",title:"Relative Surgical Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_03",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Relative Surgical Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I, myself, in this situation, would regard that the patient has relative indications for surgery.  I say relative because I think we have to talk about indications for scapular surgery in a relative sense, since we don\'t know what deformities are associated with what outcomes. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Patient Activity Level</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So you put these deformities in the context of the patient\'s lifestyle and activity level and handedness.  I think in this case, however, the shoulder instability is great, by virtue of the fact that he has a displaced double lesion, as Dr. Ring said.  Whereas I don\'t see a lot of lateral border offset or medialization. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Glenoid Translation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>In fact, there may not even be much angular deformity on the scapula Y.  There is tremendous translation.  There\'s about 300 percent translation of the glenoid, relative to its home on the glenoid neck there.  So based on that, my inclination would be to operate. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Preoperative Spine Consult </font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I do agree that this takes a very clear and well-documented conversation with your spine colleagues.  Because either you\'re going to have to position them with a halo in place, or perhaps create a lower threshold for them to stabilize the cervical spine, so that the patient can be positioned safely the way you want for surgery, which, for me, is kind of a floppy, lateral position, leaning forward, for a posterior approach. </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"MVA Associated C-Spine Injury w/ No Neurologic Deficit 45 y/o Male",title:"Surgical Approach Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_04",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Coronal Shift Correction</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>If you were to make the decision to operate, Dr. Stewart, what would your approach be? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Well, here, as you said, I think that your major challenge is going to be correcting that shift, that displacement.  It's not a medial or lateral deformity here.  It's really in the AP and the coronal plane that we just have this enormous shift over. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Posterior Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>For me, again, that's a positioning – very much like you, I like to put the hand slightly in a Statue of Liberty position, with some gentle traction, so the hand is up and slightly forward of the head, with some gentle two-pound traction on it.  And I'm, like you, approaching that from a posterior approach. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Modified Lateral Border Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Again at three weeks, I tend to use a slightly less extensile, more of a lateral border approach – the modified approach that's described, rather than a full Judet approach for many of my scapulas.  Here, something that's three weeks out – there's going to be a tremendous amount of callous. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Extensile Approach Needed</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>It's going be very hard to mobilize.  I think here, I may want a much more extensile approach, because I'm going to have to simply strip this whole thing down, in order to correct the deformity that I'm looking at. </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Those are some points really well taken. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"},{category:"MVA Associated C-Spine Injury w/ No Neurologic Deficit 45 y/o Male",title:"Fracture Personality",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_05",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Anatomic Neck Displacement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I guess when I look at the 3D CT scan, if I could point to the image here – if you look at the high vertebral angle and the vertebral border, there is really little displacement here.  All your displacement is at the so-called anatomic neck. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Suprascapular Nerve Injury</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>And, by the way, when a fracture comes up here into the spinoglenoid notch, there's a high association with a suprascapular nerve injury.  So we should watch out for that, too.  But I think with a direct posterior approach to the glenoid, you could address this tremendous translation, get the glenoid back on top of the glenoid neck, and then fix the lateral border and scapular neck in this region, perhaps leaving the rest of this alone. </p><p>I mean after all, it is three weeks old.  It has already started to heal, as Dr. Ring said.  And so that would be my inclination.  What about the clavicle, Dr. Ring? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Reorient Glenoid with Clavicle Fixation?</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>I was going to ask you – if you had this fresh – let's say within a few days – do you think, going the route that somebody suggested, that realigning and fixing the clavicle would line up the glenoid, enough to make it unnecessary to operate on it?  Or do you think the articular part of the glenoid would need something done, as well? </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>That's a really great question.  I've tried it several times. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Superior Suspensory Complex</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>It hasn't worked for me.  I think the issue of whether you get to it right away, versus in a delayed fashion, is relevant to whether one can potentially, through the suspensory complex, which occurs between the coracoid and the clavicle and the coracoacromial ligament – the so-called superior suspensory complex – if you imagine all those ligaments are intact, then you would think that reorientation could occur. </p><p>But I don't know that we can say that we know how much of that is disrupted.  But I can say on a number of occasions, I've tried it and there's been no reorientation of the glenoid.  How about yourself?  I mean, I don't think we know the answer.  But have you had any experience with that? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>We've tried, Peter, in a patient that we think that – a scapular ORIF is certainly a much bigger procedure than a clavicle, blood-loss wise, time wise, etcetera.  And there are certainly patients who, because of their overall status, we thought if we could get away with, or have a satisfactory result with a less invasive, less time-consuming operation – and because of the way I position them, I really can't do the clavicle and the scapula in the same prep.  Because I've got that arm up in traction. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Separate Procedures</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>So one of the things that we've done is to fix the clavicle, generally in a supine position, something tolerated a little better, maybe, with some of our sick intensive care patients, then take the opportunity to repeat the CT scan. </p><p>And, like you, I have found that I don't get the correction of the scapula that theoretically should be happening.  And I would say nine times out of ten, we've ended up having to go round the back – separate procedure – and fix it at the same time. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_05.jpg",vidndx:"4"},{category:"MVA Associated C-Spine Injury w/ No Neurologic Deficit 45 y/o Male",title:"Staged Procedures",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1701A/M1701A_06",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Staged Procedures</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>How about you, Dr. Ring? </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>I think they're some interesting thoughts.  I don't think anybody has a whole lot of experience doing this.  So I would just make a few points about reinforcing what you said.  I think when you get to complex, unfamiliar surgeries like this, and the jury is out about what the right thing is to do, and you try to make the best decision for the patient and for yourself, I think staging things, to the point of doing the one – doing the clavicle in the best position and the best procedure setup, and then flipping and re-prepping and doing the scapula in another one – is probably a good idea. </p><p>I think sometimes we try to do it all in one whack and, maybe, cheat ourselves a little bit.  Even to the point of – if you think there's a decent chance of winning with just the clavicle – stopping and taking a CT, to see whether you've won.  Yes, you have to re-intubate.  Yes, you have to go back to the OR. </p><p>But if the decision is between making another incision, which strips a lot of muscle, etcetera, it makes a lot of sense to me.  It's kind of like the hot and cold trauma.  What do you need to do in the middle of the night?  What do you need to do during the day?  And can you stage things?  And can you spread them out? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Surgical Familiarity with Clavicle</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>And I think for complex, unfamiliar things, like this – I think that's a very reasonable way to go.  For instance, a lot of people feel very comfortable fixing the clavicle.  I think the average surgeon now – particularly trauma surgeons – would feel comfortable with that. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Reassess after Clavicle Fixation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>Yes.  Because most surgeons feel comfortable taking care of the clavicle fracture - most orthopedic trauma surgeons.  They could phone a specialist, call Peter in Minneapolis and be in more rural Minnesota, and say, \"I'm going to try the clavicle.  I'm going to take a CT scan.  I'm sending them to you.  We'll get them to you within a week, no matter what.\" </p><p>I think that's a pretty reasonable approach, and could save a lot of time, money, effort, resources, without burning too many bridges.

I would just add a couple of things – tricks that occur to me when I look at this CT scan that\'s three weeks out.  What I like to do is save the fracture callous that invariably you get, when you take down the fracture to mobilize it, and use it as sort of a free bone graft and growth factors to put in the little cracks around the lateral border. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Suprascapular Nerve and Artery</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So that\'s a freebie I like to do.

And it's because so many x-ray series of the shoulder are imperfect.  And they can be imperfect for a lot of reasons.  They may be imperfect because the glenoid neck is spun 30 degrees. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Variable X-ray Quality</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Or they may be imperfect because the patient has a lot of swelling.  He has polytrauma, films in the trauma bay, and a cervical collar in place.  Who knows what else?  But the reality is we try to make many assessments based on shoulder x-ray series. </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>And if the patients start to have fractures or injuries that look like they might be operative, I think it's a very good idea to get the 3D CT scans.  So it's a point well taken.  I can't accurately assess the glenohumeral joint either, frankly.  You have a little more information on the 2D CT scan.  Dr. Stewart, where would you take this? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Acromion Issues</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Well, I completely agree, Peter.  I was rather relieved to hear David say that he wasn't quite sure what to make of this.  I was afraid it was just me.  Certainly you've got some displacement of the acromion, which is getting my antennae up that this is a more serious injury.  I see a very non-displaced fracture across the glenoid neck, which looks like just a crack. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">3D Image</font></i> </p><p>B5  And yet, exactly as David said, something's not right, and I don't know what it is.  So all this gives me a very high suspicion that there's something worrisome and a demand for that 3D reconstructed view, that I can do a subtraction of the humeral head, if I need to, and look into the glenoid, and make a proper decision from that.  I think I would be making an incorrect decision with that information. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Nondisplaced Glenoid Neck Fracture</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I agree with everything you've said.  If I were just to base comments on this limited information, I would say the 2D CT scan tells me there's a minimally or non-displaced fracture through the glenoid neck and the base of the coracoid. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Double Lesion</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>And so even though some people might call that a double lesion of the superior suspensory complex, I ask myself – “If these heal where they are, will the patient do well?”  And of course they will.  On the x-ray scan, I don't see the lateral border particularly displaced.  I see some complex fracture pattern in the neck, and extending into the body. </p><p>But, again, it's not so displaced.  So I guess we all conclude the information is incomplete.

Here's another clinical scenario.  We have a couple of APs - one from posterior, one from anterior - 3D CT reconstructions.

This is the great debate about – is it medialization of the more cephalad fragment?  Or is it lateralization of the distal fragment?  Or is it simply displacement.  And I think if we look from here, to what I think should be here – and I'm going to have to spin that fragment a little bit, and make sure that's actually what's going to come up and line up – is that a 1.5 or 2-centimeter displacement? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Translation</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>And that's one of the criteria with which I'm trying to sort of quantify my thinking.  There's a point at which I say, “That's so displaced, I think it will do better with fixation and restoration of the anatomic structure.”  And that one – that's a bit of a “tweener.”  I agree with everything David said, that, again, this AP translation is in the direction that doesn't worry me. </p><p>Nor is it the magnitude – there's perhaps a one-centimeter translation here, which I'm certainly not worried about.

If that's a 21-year-old professional tennis player, am I more likely to want to restore his native architecture, and eliminate that “medialization?”  That's a “tweener” for me. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1879A/M1879A_02.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"Scapula Body and Neck Fracture 27 y/o Male",title:"Displacement Issues",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1879A/M1879A_03",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Surgical vs. Nonsurgical Indications</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Okay.  I guess my interpretation of this one is that it does not need surgical indications.  I think some of the comments you brought up beg some interesting speculation.  And that is, if you fix it, will they rehabilitate quicker? </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Medialization Issues</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>What's the meaning of 15 millimeters of so-called medialization in the long run?  But I think that the shoulder will compensate very nicely for this injury.  I think it has a high likelihood of healing with essentially a normal outcome. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Glenopolar Angle</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Now one thing I would say.  When I see the lateral border or pillar on the lateral, like this, displaced or translated, this is a patient that I'll watch closely.  So I measure the glenopolar angle here, which by the way, the glenopolar angle goes from the bottom of the glenoid to its apex. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Contralateral X-ray</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Or let me come over here – bottom of the glenoid to the apex, to the inferior pole – right here at the inferior pole.  This is looking, to me, like about 35 degrees, which is roughly normal.  I would get an opposite AP shoulder to make sure.  I don't think there's a lot of lateral border offset here. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Glenoid Medial to Lateral Border</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So I'm not worried about that.  It's when I see the glenoid medial to the lateral border that you really start to appreciate this displacement.  And then here, there's no angular deformity – maybe five degrees, at most.  So that doesn't bother me either. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Re-assess at 2 Weeks</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So I would put him in a sling, tell him not to move for a week-and-a-half or two, until it gets sticky, re-x-ray in a week, make sure that it doesn't antevert, or the glenopolar angle doesn't, with the gravity of the arm, start to shift down, and make a non-operative call on this one. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Gravity Displacement Potential</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>And I think you make a great point there, Peter, about close follow up at a week to see what gravity's doing.  We're looking, right now, to see the difference between the supine clavicle films and what happens when that patient is simply sitting up again. </p><p>And we're repeating all of those films prior to discharge.  And we've had an awful lot of people go from a non-operative position. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Surgical Indication Change</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>As soon as we simply sit them up – and as you say, the gravity of the arm – that's a big appendage, especially in some of our heavier patients – to a significant displacement, that puts them, for me, into an operative category. </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>I wonder if that same type of principle – we should at least be looking for it in the scapula.  Is this going to change and become something that's more clearly an operative indication? </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1879A/M1879A_03.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"Scapula Body and Neck Fracture 27 y/o Male",title:"Medialization vs. Lateralization",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1879A/M1879A_04",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Glenoid Medialization or Body Lateralization?</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>This particular injury is a good one to discuss, with the images in front of us, of what your thoughts are about the issue of medialization of the glenoid versus lateralization of the body. Do you have any specific thoughts on that subject in general, Dr. Stewart? </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Well, I've looked at the patients on a chest x-ray.  And if you are indeed medializing the glenoid, you should see a very significant difference if you measure them from some common point, like the middle of the sternum outwards.  And you really don't seem to see that. </p><p>So my Gestalt is that it's actually lateralizing some of the elements.  I certainly think the jury's out.  I don't think we know the answer.  I think the displacement is important, whether one piece is moving one way or the other.  And I think it's an important criterion to look for.  But I really think the jury's out. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Shortening Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>How about you, Dr. Ring? </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>Well, I would say that it may be semantics.  I'm not sure it makes a difference in the outcome.  I liked what you were saying before about – and almost make an analogy with the clavicle.  If you talk about how much shortening is too much shortening in the clavicle, there's a lot of debate. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Subtle Complicating Factors</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>Why?  Well, because it's hard to measure shortening accurately.  And what it causes, if anything, is a very subtle problem that's hard to measure.  It's not going to affect range of motion.  It's not going to affect necessarily strength – although Mike McKee is trying to measure that. </p><p>And it's going to be subtle things, like throwing or rock climbing or overhead activities that are going to be diminished, and those are not captured in the DASH.  And let alone – they're washed out by all the other things that influence a DASH, including a person's distress level, life situation, and coping strategies. </p><p>The medialization, like in this case, is a good way to get people comfortable with the controversies.  I think we get too hung up on being right or wrong, black or white, when, in reality, it's important to say, \"Well, it could be a problem because the anatomy is distorted.  And it affects the way things line up – the rotator cuff and all that.\" </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Controversial Issues</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>A rationale for this being an operative – benefiting from surgery is certainly there.  And yet the shoulder girdle is relatively forgiving, and it's hard to measure when you're making a difference.  And that's why there's room for controversy. </p><p>And there are strong feelings on either side, which tend to polarize things.  But I don't think that's really useful.  I think we should emphasize why there's room for debate, and then accept that there is room for debate. </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I like the way you said that.  Personally, I don't have strong feelings because I don't think it matters.  When we talk about a femur fracture, we talk about the displacement of the proximal end to the distal end.  We don't talk about the distal end to the pelvis. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Glenohumeral Joint Soft Tissue Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>What difference does that make?  What matters is that the muscles that are crossing the glenohumeral joint are crossing the fracture.  And we know that eighteen muscles originate, cross, or insert on the scapular.  So certainly the optimum resting length of those muscles is changed, and the vectors at which they act are changed. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Nonoperative Compromise</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So big deal whether it's medialized or lateralized.  I do think that there are patients that you see in the office, sometimes having been treated non-operatively at, say, another center, and you can see the depression of the shoulder girdle and it appears as though the shoulder is very drooped. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Both Medialization and Lateralization</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>And so visually, it appears down and in, or like it would be medialized.  And certainly that corresponds with the mechanism of injury of a lateral blow to the forequarter.  And certainly it corresponds with the many times we see eight to ten or twelve ribs that are crushed in toward the mediastinum. </p><p>So I think that probably there is both.  There is some lateralization of the body, which occurs because the long head of the triceps inserts on the lateral border and there's probably also some medialization of the glenohumeral joint, or perhaps it's variable in patients.  Perhaps it's different when they get up than when they're lying down. </p><p>And so using trauma bay CT scanner x-rays when the patient is supine at day one is not where they're going to end up at two or three weeks or three months.  So the jury's out.  I agree. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1879A/M1879A_04.jpg",vidndx:"3"}]},discuss6:{data:[{category:"True Scapula Neck Associated with Body and Displaced Coracoid 35 y/o Male",title:"Multiple Plane Injury",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1880A/M1880A_01",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Multiple Plane Injury</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>In front of us is a 3D CT scan of a young patient who happened to be a body builder - 35-years-old.

It's the most reliable landmark for me.  I think you're going to get a very good bony key.  That's one area that tends not to crush, or comminute.  And I think you're going to get an excellent read of your restoration. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Posterior Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>So I'm going to start, again, with a posterior approach to all of that, and focus my efforts on getting that glenoid rotated correctly, raised back up, and getting an anatomic reduction on the border. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1880A/M1880A_01.jpg",vidndx:"1"},{category:"True Scapula Neck Associated with Body and Displaced Coracoid 35 y/o Male",title:"Coracoid Considerations",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1880A/M1880A_01",script:'<p><i><font size="-2">Posterior Reconstruction</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>So you\'ve reconstructed, from posterior, the scapular neck, and restored the lateral pillar.  And then you rotate.  And this is your coracoid. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Accessing the Coracoid</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Dr. Ring, what would you do, at this point, with the coracoid? </p><p>And could you have gotten to it from posterior? </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>Well, maybe you could reach for it and grab it.  That seems pretty risky to me. </p><p><b>Dr. Stewart:</b> </p><p>Absolutely. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Separate Coracoid Approach</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>So I think that\'s a separate exposure and it\'s got some of the bone that helps you key in your glenoid.  And I\'m not exactly sure where the superior glenoid is, but I think it\'s on another piece, still with the scapular spine.  But just to know where to put your glenoid, the lateral border will be a good idea. </p><p><i><font size="-2">Distorted Anatomy</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>You look at this, and you say, "This is really distorted anatomy."  And for those who say, “I never operated on a scapula,” this may test that.  And how can somebody say, “I never operated on a scapula” with cases like this? </p><p><i><font size="-2">Nonoperative Treatment Compromises</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>Because even though it\'s so far messed up, you will get a decent range of motion.  It will heal.  But almost certainly, this is going to affect the function of the shoulder in some degree, even though those higher order things we\'re used to measuring - that you can get union, you can get a decent range of motion - are going to be different. </p><p>So this is certainly a case that, with such wide displacement, makes it hard to just cavalierly say, "They never need to be fixed." </p><p><i><font size="-2">Fixation Principles</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I couldn\'t agree with you more.  Putting evidence aside, and just speaking from a principle standpoint, if we treat basically all our long bones according to the principles of restoration of length, alignment, and rotation, how could one not apply that principle to this very dramatic situation? </p>',thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1880A/M1880A_01.jpg",vidndx:"2"},{category:"True Scapula Neck Associated with Body and Displaced Coracoid 35 y/o Male",title:"Suprascapular Nerve Injury",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1880A/M1880A_01",script:"<p><i><font size=\"-2\">Spinoglenoid Notch Involvement</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>I think that the only thing I could add to what you have said is simply that it's important to recognize that this fracture goes right up into the spinoglenoid notch, and is associated with a suprascapular nerve injury, as it was in this patient. He had a complete tear of the suprascapular nerve – after fixation, had atrophy of the infraspinatus. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Suprascapular Nerve Tear</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>But functionally did very well, and actually went back to body building and racing supercross motorbikes.  So interestingly enough, I have found that patients, even with profound suprascapular nerve injuries at the level of the spinoglenoid notch which does not affect the supraspinatus, seem to compensate very well. </p><p>Now they're not overhead-throwing athletes, but they have strong outcomes with good motion and good DASH scores; so not to prognosticate in such a way as to say they'll have a bad outcome just because they have a suprascapular nerve injury. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Rare Injury</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>Most of the suprascapular nerve injuries, I assume, are neuropraxias or crushed.  And this must be a rare case to see it actually torn. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Usually Crush Injury</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>Yes.  That's true.  Usually it's a crush injury.  There's a recovery in a certain percentage of patients.  And many times, it's a single branch of the nerve that starts to fan out under the undersurface of the infraspinatus.  And so this is a rare case, which is a complete tear. </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>In analogy with the humerus, it's not lacerated by a fracture.  It's probably ripped apart. </p><p><i><font size=\"-2\">Nerve Graft Considerations</font></i> </p><p><b>Dr. Ring:</b> </p><p>In which case, you probably need to graft it.  Do you get hand surgeons involved?  How do you manage that? </p><p><b>Dr. Cole:</b> </p><p>It's an interesting question.  I have sent a number of these patients to my colleagues on the Brachial Plexus Service at Mayo Clinic, who do a lot of these considerations for muscular transfers and nerve grafting. </p><p>And the reality is the suprascapular nerve dysfunction, when the lesion occurs at the spinoglenoid notch, having followed twelve to fifteen of these patients, it's not terribly morbid.  And so now, neither from the Mayo Clinic nor from our own hospital do we recommend specific interventions for grafting or muscle transfers, just for a suprascapular nerve lesion.  Axillary nerve or other brachial plexus lesions - that's a different animal. </p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1880A/M1880A_01.jpg",vidndx:"3"}]}},doctorBios={jupiterjesse:{data:[{name:"Jesse B.
