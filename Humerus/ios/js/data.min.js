This wrist crease here, if you extend this around, it takes you to the middle of the scaphoid.  So we know that the radial styloid will be here.  The ulnar styloid will be here.</p><p>So a standard volar approach will take us between the radial artery and the flexor carpi radialis.  The incision will be here.  If we want more extension, we can make an incision like that.</p><p>So this will allow us to have ready access to the volar radial aspect of the distal radius and is very acceptable for most fractures of the distal radius with the exception of highly comminuted fractures, those which have primarily an ulnar component, so a dorsal, volar, lunate facet type problem, or those with high energy that we have to decompress the soft tissues.</p><p>So generally, we can deal with this very effectively by extending along the borders between the radial artery and flexor carpi radialis.</p><p>I&#039;ve always felt that the surgeons should sit in the armpit to allow a better exposure, but sometimes you need very good assistants that don&#039;t get tired when they have to hold the retractors.</p><p>So here, we&#039;re looking at the flexor carpi radialis.  You&#039;ll see the artery here.  Now, this is the fascia over the flexor carpi radialis.  It allows us to come down between the artery and the flexor carpi radialis.</p><p>Over here, there&#039;s always a crossing small arteriole and vein off of the bundle.  We have to cauterize that.  Primarily, the palmar cutaneous branch of the median nerve will be over on this side, but it&#039;s very useful to keep that in mind because, occasionally, there&#039;s an aberrant branch of the palmar cutaneous nerve, which supplies this area, and we should look out for that.</p><p>So by going between the radial artery and flexor carpi radialis, we next come down to the fascia over the flexor pollicis longus.  So I will have my assistant have a slightly bigger retractor and not pull very hard because we&#039;re attracting the radial artery and the venae comitantes.</p><p>So right here is the fascia over the flexor carpi &#x2013; the flexor carpi radialis.  Now, this is the fascia over the flexor pollicis longus.  Once we open that up, we can begin to come down to the muscle.  There&#039;s a little extra fat here.  Here, we see the muscle belly.</p><p>Okay.  So now, if I hold a retractor here, maybe I can show you a little bit of the motion itself.</p><p>Now, we come down over the fascia.  Now, we&#039;re onto the &#x2013; we pulled over the flexor pollicis longus here and we&#039;re onto the pronator quadratus.</p><p>How do you take the pronator quadratus?  Well, we would like to have some opportunity, if necessary, to repair it, so either leave some muscle here or we&#039;ll repair it to the brachioradialis, which is slightly more radial.</p><p>So now, we&#039;re down to the pronator quadratus.  One can sharply elevate this.  As we come across, remember this landmark, which is the waist of the scaphoid, and here&#039;s the radial styloid.  We come out where the flexor pollicis longus is here.  Now, the pronator quadratus ends right here.</p><p>The important thing to understand is that&#039;s not where the end of the radius ends, so that there&#039;s an area which we term the &quot;watershed zone,&quot; which is the capsule of the wrist covering the very rim of the radial border of the radius, the distal border.</p><p>So we&#039;ve now exposed the area of the end of the radius.  With a fracture, I would like to put in a baby Hohmann and allow this exposure.  I will put a second one on this side to show that basically I&#039;ve exposed a good part of the end of the radius.</p><p>If we have a concern of where we are with regard to the end of the radius, a K-wire coming into the joint, which would be right here, will give us a good exposure.</p><p>Now, the other important landmark here is where the tendon of the brachioradialis attaches.  We see that right here.  This is the tendon of the brachioradialis.</p><p>So if we need more exposure, if we have trouble reducing the fracture, we can section the brachioradialis to help us get more exposure as such.  One can use the brachioradialis to even repair the pronator quadratus back to it.</p><p>Finally, I should tell you that there are some fractures that have split longitudinally this way and it&#039;s very useful to put a second implant along the radial column, so to speak.  This can be done from the palmar approach as we have here.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1296A/M1296A_1.jpg"},{category:"Standard Volar Approach to the Distal Radius (Henry)",title:"Extending to the Ulnar Column",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1296A-Approaches_VADR/01b_M1296A",script:"<p>Now, there may be a time where I have a more complex fracture and I want to get more exposure.</p><p>So remember, the flexor carpi radialis is right here.  So by opening up the sheath of the flexor carpi radialis, going more distally, it will allow the flexor carpi radialis to be retracted further in an ulnar direction.  I will therefore have an opportunity to get over to the more ulnar aspect of the end of the radius.</p><p>So this would be the volar lunate facet area that is a critical part of fixing some of these fractures.</p><p>So by freeing up the flexor carpi radialis, I have now exposed all the way to the lunate facet and even to the distal radial ulnar joint.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1296A/M1296A_2.jpg"},{category:"Standard Volar Approach to the Distal Radius (Henry)",title:"Summary of the Exposure",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1296A-Approaches_VADR/01c_M1296A",script:"<p>So this is the standard volar approach.

We can extend this more proximally if necessary.  Here is the end of the radius.  Remember that the pronator quadratus ended here, so we have this degree of volar distal radius that is not covered by the pronator quadratus.</p><p>Also, realize that the radial styloid is more anterior than the middle of the distal radius and the ulnar lunate facet is more anterior.  So it goes anterior, then a little bit more dorsal, and then anterior again.

So an incision that will come as such and then extend to the end of the wrist crease here and then come across like that can allow you to release all of these structures and get a more extensile exposure.</p><p>So we&#039;re going to extend this incision obliquely across the wrist crease, not straight across, and then come down through the interval between the ulnar artery and nerve and flexor tendons.</p><p>So if we can retract here.  Thank you.</p><p>So we&#039;re right at the transverse fascia here.  We&#039;ll come more proximally to give you an understanding of the interval that I&#039;m talking about.  So we&#039;ll move this down here.</p><p>That&#039;s right.</p><p>This is the end of the transverse carpal ligament.</p><p>Now, if you have a situation where there&#039;s a young person and we want to preserve this, it can be done by repairing the ligament at the end in a Z-plasty.  So we&#039;re releasing the whole transverse carpal ligament and now extending more proximally.</p><p>Here&#039;s the ulnar artery.  The ulnar nerve will be with it.  So the interval will be taken by elevating this whole structure up as such.</p><p>The flexor tendons are &#x2013; we can come out there &#x2013; are protecting the median nerve effectively.</p><p>Let me just take this here.  There&#039;s a little vein there coming up.</p><p>Okay.  So now, we&#039;re down.  This is a wonderful exposure &#x2013; we can take these out there &#x2013; because it &#x2013; you&#039;ll really see the end of the ulnar side of the radius.</p><p>So here&#039;s the flexor carpi ulnaris, ulnar nerve, and ulnar artery.</p><p>Now, I can come with my baby Hohmann and come across all the way over.  Now, I think we&#039;ll see that this patient may have had an old injury.  But by coming in here, I can expose the end of the radius and I believe this patient had a old fracture.</p><p>So this is a very extensile exposure.  We can come across all the way to the radial styloid over here.   Hold that there.  What you see here is an abnormal anatomy.  I believe this patient had an old fracture.</p><p>This is the pronator quadratus being elevated from the radial side here.  Now, we&#039;re across the whole end of the radius.  Here, we have some old trauma, but this is the exposure.</p><p>Now, if I only had a volar lunate facet fracture, I would make the incision from here to here, taking the same interval between the flexor tendons and the ulnar artery and nerve, and realize that I have then perfect exposure of the distal radial ulna joint.  This is the distal radial ulnar joint here.  This would be the volar lunate facet, which this particular patient has had an old injury.  It&#039;s quite distorted.</p><p>So I can treat that effectively just with this small approach.

I take the part of the ligament and then I would repair that over the tendons like that.

We&#039;ll look at that in a bit. But having made this approach, we come down on the extensor retinaculum.</p>  <p>We can retract here.</p><p>Here&#039;s the extensor retinaculum.</p><p>So there are different options.  One option might be to make two incisions to the retinaculum leaving the extensor pollicis longus intact, which runs right through here, or opening up one and then elevating between the tendons.

That will allow you to get access to the ulnar styloid.</p><p>Right here will be the beginning of our search for any evidence of sensory nerves.  So we look carefully to make sure whether or not there is a branch of the nerve.  So you can rest assured that it will be there.  It&#039;s just a matter of where.</p><p>Bingo.  You see.  Right there.  So by knowing where the nerve might be and look exactly where that line is we can avoid injury.</p><p>So now, this is just simply the retinaculum extending down to the volar aspect of the ulna.  So it&#039;s almost a subcutaneous approach.  The important features are primarily that the crossing sensory branches and that the styloid is more anterior.</p><p>So the ulnar head comes out here, but the styloid tends to be more anterior.  So I&#039;d like to get a better look at the ulnar styloid.</p><p>So if we had a fracture and we&#039;d be trying to fix this ulnar styloid alone, I would have to be very cautious about the nerve and my work would be down here and not up here.</p> <p>If someone thinks to make a dorsal incision here, they may have a good deal of problems treating the styloid because it&#039;s so anterior.</p>  <p>So now, we&#039;re down here and we have quite a distorted ulna, probably an old injury.  But this is where the styloid is.  So it&#039;s very anterior in some patients.</p><p>So this patient had an old injury and we have distortion of the end of the ulna.

One can extend the incision as needed, approximately, if you need to put in an implant.</p>  <p>So that&#039;s the major issues with approach to the ulna, watching out for the sensory nerve and recognizing the styloid is more anterior or volar than the ulnar head.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1295A/M1295A.jpg"}]}},discussions={discuss1:{data:[{category:"Current Perspectives on the Distal Radius",title:"Brief History",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1310A-Discussion-Jupiter/01_Brief_History",script:"<p>A number of years ago I had the opportunity of writing a book with a colleague from Switzerland, Diego Fernandez, and the book was all about distal radius fractures.  And we gave it to two of our mentors, one his who was a very famous Swiss surgeon, Maurice Mueller, and the other to mine who was a very famous orthopedic surgeon in Boston, Henry Mankin.  Maurice Mueller wrote in his foreword about how accurate it was that we were describing the methods of treatment and the surgical treatment, and many other things.  Dr. Mankin, my mentor, said, &quot;It&#039;s a very nice book, but why do you have to have a book about distal radius fractures?  It&#039;s not a problem.&quot;  And if you look at what&#039;s occurred over those 10 or 15 years when we produced this book, it&#039;s been an explosion of interest in what was thought to be not a problem.</p> <p>In the past people with distal radius fractures were treated very much the same way; they were treated with casts and we had a certain amount of problems, but it was not a problem because problems that, if they occurred they were treated as they were.  But it was considered part of the injury, you see?  But over time several things have happened.  Number one is a technological explosion in terms of the magnitude of devices to treat fractures.  The second was the understanding of the fracture patterns with new technology that gave you three-dimensional imaging, CAT scans, 3-D CAT scans.  So what used to be called a Colles&#039; fracture, now all of the sudden becomes a two-part, three-part with all of these variations of the theme.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1310A/M1310A_1.jpg"},{category:"Current Perspectives on the Distal Radius",title:"Educated Patients",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1310A-Discussion-Jupiter/02_Educated_Patients",script:"<p>And the final thing was patient expectations.  Patients became understanding in North America that their expectation was that they should return to the status they were before the injury with very little input.  That they should be treated to be rehabilitated very quickly.  This was something that was recognized in Europe, where they developed a lot of techniques with internal fixation, but was not quite the same in America.</p>  <p>So when I was a resident and then when I was in my practice for ten years, if I said you needed an operation people would go, &quot;Oh my God, are you kidding?  Why?&quot;  Today if I said you don&#039;t need an operation, they would say, &quot;Are you sure, doctor?  I was sent here for an operation.&quot;  So the, what we say the paradigm has shifted so much, but the reasons it&#039;s shifted so much is because of those three points I mentioned.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1310A/M1310A_2.jpg"},{category:"Current Perspectives on the Distal Radius",title:"Technological Impact",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1310A-Discussion-Jupiter/03_Technological_Impact",script:"<p>What happened was that while we wanted to do better treatment with earlier rehabilitation, most of the people that had distal radius fractures were, for the most part, older people with osteoporosis and traditional methods were okay for simple fractures, but not for more complex fractures.  We couldn&#039;t hold the bone with screws and probably in the late &#039;80s, early &#039;90s, a group of us developed a method to fix these fractures with screws or bolts that locked in the plate.  All of the sudden people realized that we could use a different form of technology to fix these osteoporotic fractures.  Very interesting that it was, at that time, not fully appreciated, this technology, which has exploded into now being considered the standard, you see?</p><p>Still there was a mixed group, one would treat this way, one would treat that way.  And then people started to realize, in America, that you can treat many of these with a metal plate and screws, a lock plate on the volar surface and perhaps avoid some of the problems with irritation of the dorsal tendons.  Okay, so what happened was, guess what, it became very commonplace to do this, and so it became a treatment of many surgeons all over the country, for the reasons that you could avoid casts in older people, that it was a surgical treatment for surgeons, and it was pretty predictable.

And so as people have approached this much more with these techniques and this technology, they realized hey, it&#039;s not a bad thing.  And so it&#039;s become almost the standard treatment.</p> <p>So which fractures do you treat, which fractures do you look at for other methods?  Unfortunately, as things shift it becomes how do I fix the fracture to the plate?  And in some cases we&#039;ve forgotten the approaches we&#039;ve always done for fractures, and that is to figure out what the fracture is and how you fix the fracture, maybe with one plate, maybe with two, maybe with a cast, maybe with pins.  So as an evolution, like everything else, technology has spurned a tremendous shift in treatment.</p><p>Are patients better off?  Remarkably better off, but like everything else the more that&#039;s done of something, the more likely you&#039;re to see some problems associated with it.  That&#039;s not to say you shouldn&#039;t be doing it, but you have to realize that, like everything else, any intervention creates some risks and problems.</p>  <p>So what happens in general community?

Okay, the rationale is that for the most part, for most of these fractures through a locked volar plate, especially the Colles&#039; type fractures, you can do this with a good reduction and a good secure fixation.  That you don&#039;t need a cast for the patient, that they can rehabilitate their arm more quickly, that you avoid some of the problems with swelling and dystrophy, et cetera, and guess what, it may well be cost effective because you may not need to have so many x-rays, you may not need to have so much therapy, you may not have to follow the patient in clinic so often.  And you have to go to the operating room anyhow, so there is a good rationale for that treatment, per se.</p> <p>Should it be done by everyone?  For the most part, yes.  But that&#039;s the Colles&#039; fractures, okay.  Should it be done instead of a cast?  Not necessarily because a cast is a treatment as a plating, as a surgery.  It has to be done well, one has to avoid swelling, one has to get the patient moving, and so it shouldn&#039;t be done if you can control a fracture in a cast.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1310A/M1310A_5.jpg"},{category:"Current Perspectives on the Distal Radius",title:"Decision-making Process",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1310A-Discussion-Jupiter/06_Decision-making_Process",script:"<p>So what we&#039;ve learned, or what the decision-making process is, is involving deciding is this fracture able to be reduced and held in a cast or with pins?  If not, then these locking plates are great.  Now, what I&#039;ve seen over time is a dramatic change in training, in people&#039;s perspectives, and what&#039;s unfortunately the problem is, that I would have to say, very much like a professional golfer who&#039;s now wanting in his training, he&#039;s going to the PGA school, he wants to be the best to get on the tour, he has to learn how to use every club in every possible way because he can&#039;t always use his favorite club.  And so what needs to be done with this facture in training, and every other fracture, per se, is that people have to learn how to use alternative methods because you can&#039;t always apply this one type of device.</p>  <p>So I still believe that we should have in our ability to treat these other ways.  But I&#039;ve seen this progression and I&#039;ve had the opportunity to treat many patients with casts.  I&#039;ve realized the historical perspectives, it&#039;s remarkable if you look at historical perspectives of distal radius and how many problems there were, to realize what an advance this has been.  So I&#039;ve had the opportunity to learn about that, I&#039;ve had the opportunity to see people treated in casts, and have had the opportunity to treat people with external fixation and pins, and actually they&#039;ve done very well.

You say, &quot;Yeah, you&#039;ll have some problems here and there,&quot; but it&#039;s been such a dramatic change that I don&#039;t think that at this moment we&#039;re going to change.  But it&#039;s not the end because everywhere else we&#039;re looking at less invasive treatments, okay?  And here in this area we&#039;ve gone to more invasive treatments.  And so I would say in the next ten years we&#039;re going to see less invasive treatments for some of these, for these same simpler fractures we&#039;re going to see injection of things, we&#039;re going to see little kind of devices that expand to hold the fracture put in through a small hole, and things like that.</p> <p>So I don&#039;t think that these plates and screws will be the final methodology for most of these simpler fractures.  Still for these difficult fractures, they are helpful.

But I think, think outside the box and think where is the fracture&hellip;</p><p>Think about the columns, where is the fracture displacement.  If  you need to get a CAT scan, you know we never used to get CAT scans when I was a resident, but now we realize sometimes we need to know where those fragments are.  And think about all these other approaches; there&#039;s many ways to do it and you might need an Ex-fix plus a plate.  So there&#039;s not just one way to fix these.</p><p>I always put the drill bit in that ulnar corner.  I mean that&#039;s just a pearl you have to do to keep you out of trouble.  I&#039;ve not had to screw in a joint because if I&#039;m not just right, then I readjust it; I always do that.  I always cover the plate with the pronator if I can.  I always do the distal fragment first, even if it&#039;s only doing the ulnar side.  So if I have an interarticular split I need to get the ulnar corner locked in because it&#039;s unstable and I can&#039;t get it to work right; I&#039;ll always do the ulnar corner first and even reducing the plate to the shaft.</p><p>So I always do the ulnar corner first, whether it has to be from the interarticular  split or a metaphyseal comminuted fracture.  I always do that first.</p><p>Always see them back in a couple of weeks to take the stitches out and I start early motion in a couple weeks.  I always put them in a splint and let them bathe.</p><p><b>Dr. Jupiter</b>: I always preoperative plan.  I always look at them, when I see them in first visit before the surgery, I look at the x-rays, I look at the instruments.</p><p>I say, &quot;Do we have this and do we have this, do we have this, do we have this?&quot;  Because I know I may need this, I may need this because of that.  Yeah.  Do I do a drawing?  No, I don&#039;t do drawings so much anymore because I do it in my head.  Okay?  And I think that that, yeah, you have to do that.  You have to, you can&#039;t walk in the operating room without a real confident feeling of what you need and how you&#039;re going to approach it.  Of course you should tell the patient too, sometimes you have to make an incision on the bottom and an incision on the top.  And if the patient wakes up and says, &quot;Why was it here,&quot; you know?  So it&#039;s good to do that, everybody should do that.</p><p>People should understand the fracture before they operate.</p><p>They should make a little drawing or a plan, and if they&#039;re not comfortable looking at x-rays, to get 3-D computer scans.</p><p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: I think you got to have a good x-ray, you just have to know what you&#039;re looking at in the office.  That doesn&#039;t, for me it doesn&#039;t require CT, I just have to have a standard x-ray that I can see that lateral view to know what the joint surface looks like, and obliques.  I want to know if I can see an articular fracture fragment, and I think you have to repeat that until you get what you want to be comfortable with what you&#039;re seeing in the office.</p><p>I don&#039;t really need a CT very often, rarely ever order one, but I think you have to have good x-rays in your office that you could take.  The x-rays that come from the outside are not always what you want.</p><p><b>Dr. Jupiter</b>:   Imaging is the most important thing.  To understand what&#039;s involved, what component parts of the end of the radius.</p><p>But you&#039;re now in a new animal, you&#039;re in a new injury.  It&#039;s no longer a Colles&#039; fracture or a distal radius fracture.  It&#039;s a wrist injury that may have ligament problems, may have distal radial ulnar problems.  Entirely different.</p><p>So imaging is the best way to get a sense of what you&#039;re dealing with.</p><p>I don&#039;t use things like external fixation or percutaneous pins and external fixation, whereas I used them routinely in the past.  I go more to internal plates and screws because in my hands I feel capable and confident with the external fixation and pins, but I know there are limits.  And so because of that, I find that I&#039;m much more comfortable and the situation is more predictable with internal plates and screws.</p><p>You have to realize that we&#039;ve developed these little plates and screws that are so specialized for the end of the radius that it&#039;s not like the older days where you were applying an implant to try and push the fracture to an implant.</p><p>Now you&#039;re taking and tailoring the implant to the specific fracture, so it gives you a lot more opportunities to be individualized to that fracture.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1311A/M1311A_1.jpg"},{category:"Tips &amp; Pearls from the Experts: Distal Radius",title:"Avoiding Problems",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1311A-Discussion/02_Avoiding_Problems",script:"<p><b>Dr. Jupiter</b>: The thing that will cause the most problems for a patient are things that are not related to the bone, and so if a patient has a nerve that&#039;s under pressure that&#039;s not released or there&#039;s too much traction on a nerve, that will create a complex pain problem that that patient may never recover.  If they have too much swelling they may lose motion in their fingers, that&#039;s a big problem.  So we concentrate so much as orthopedic surgeons on the bone, but the end is all of these other component parts that are the wolves in sheep&#039;s clothing because they&#039;re not showing up on an x-ray.  You see?</p><p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: I think you have to watch these fractures.  Even the nondisplaced fractures I think have to be watched pretty close.  As we get older we&#039;re all going to be more active, we want good, healthy wrists, we want good motion, and they tend to fall off, even they can fall off.  I think they&#039;ve have to be watched.</p><p>So you have to watch for dorsal comminution on that lateral x-ray, and those people have a tendency to want to collapse some over time and their tilt starts drifting over time.  Some people see a nondisplaced fracture and they put them in a cast and see them in six weeks, I think they have to be watched a little closer than that.</p><p>I see the ones that don&#039;t work well or they were seen for four or five weeks and now they come in and they&#039;re 20, 30 degrees dorsal tilt, they&#039;ve lost their radial inclination, and now I&#039;ve have to go back in and take it down and redo it and it&#039;s a lot different animal.  It&#039;s much more difficult to do, a lot more swelling.  It&#039;s more difficult for the patient to deal with and there&#039;s more soft tissue contraction at that point.  So I think they&#039;ve just have to be watched.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: I think first we have to remember the sigmoid notch is there, restore that, then if the bony anatomy is restored whatever we do with the distal radius at the end test the DRUJ because I put them on the table, assess the stability because that can be unstable.  If we miss that, that&#039;s a huge problem because people, as you&#039;re saying, people come back and they say, &quot;Well, I don&#039;t care if my x-ray looks okay, I can&#039;t rotate.&quot;</p><p>So if the DRUJ is unstable you have to address it, it might be an open approach to the TFCC, it might pinning, it might be the ulnar styloid.  If there&#039;s an ulnar styloid fracture we have to look at that and address it in some way; we could talk about that for a long time.  But I think don&#039;t let the DRUJ be a problem after you fix the distal radius.</p><p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: The distal ulna fractures associated with a distal radius fracture, that&#039;s a different animal and that&#039;s more difficult to deal with.</p><p>I think you have to address the distal radius first, you have to get it linked back, and then you have to address the ulna.  Whether there&#039;s instability between the radius and the ulna, do you need to pin that ulnar styloid fracture fragment that you commonly see?  Is there a big ulnar head fracture that you need to put some screws in or a plate on?</p><p>I think that distal radius, distal ulna is a different animal that you&#039;ve have to address.  The fracture that&#039;s translated, that&#039;s a different animal</p><p>So you have a distal radius, not only is it tilted, but it&#039;s translated, slid across.  You&#039;ve have to get that pushed back over, otherwise it&#039;s going to have problems with the distal radial joint; that joint needs to be lined up as well.  So that&#039;s a kind of bad animal.</p><p><b>Dr. Jupiter</b>:  People should really get a better understanding, or at least have a confident understanding of the surgical approach because once you have mastered that most of these fractures, these Colles&#039; fracture, are pretty amenable to this new technology.  But you&#039;re asking people now who in the past would have treated these fractures, or many of these, without surgery to now do surgery; that&#039;s the confounding variable.  You see?</p><p>Reduction is not so hard.  It&#039;s the same maneuvers as you did if you put a fixator or pins or whatever.  Okay?  Putting screws in, you know, a two-year-old can do that, but it&#039;s the surgical approach that really affords you the ability to do this technology.  So fairly little emphasis is put on that.</p><p>So I would say that that&#039;s where an area that people should make sure they&#039;re confident in.  I see a lot of patients who have had surgery and the approach wasn&#039;t good enough for that surgeon, they struggled, you see, and they ended up not being able to fix the fracture so well because they didn&#039;t have the right approach.  And, you know, books and videos make it look easy, but it&#039;s not so easy.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1311A/M1311A_2.jpg"},{category:"Tips &amp; Pearls from the Experts: Distal Radius",title:"Pitfalls and Complications",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1311A-Discussion/03_Pitfalls_Complications",script:"<p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: For me the pitfalls of this, you have to know where your screws are going, you have to know in the very beginning where they&#039;re going otherwise you have to change the position of that plate.</p><p>And I do that with drill bits, some people do it with a guide pin or a K-wire.  I just use drill bits, it&#039;s easier for me.  It&#039;s one shot, I take it out and I move on.</p><p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: Not every fracture utilizes this plate.  On occasion there&#039;s an articular fracture, radial styloid fracture that the ulnar side&#039;s not involved.  There&#039;s some angled plates still locking from the volar side that can be applied and reduce that fracture and put it in place.  Additional K-wires sometimes are needed; the radial styloid can be comminuted.  At times you have to apply some pressure and pull distally on the radial side.</p><p>Fix ulnar side first, then pull the radial side with a freer or tease that fragment up to realign the joint surface, place the K-wire, and then put your screws underneath the subchondral bone and bone graft behind it.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: There might have been a case that, properly done, the palmar plate could effectively treat it, and it just wasn&#039;t put on right.  We have to remember that if we put a palmar plate on, it&#039;s a whole different reduction maneuver.  We used to put it on for a volar plate and it&#039;s easy, lay the hand out and push it down for a volar Barton.  But now if you&#039;re doing it for a dorsal fracture you have to bring the bone and reduce everything up and flex it before you put your distal screws on.</p><p>So I don&#039;t know if everybody&#039;s doing that.  So it could be that or it could be a fracture that has these little subtle die punch fractures or die punch fragments, the volar fragment that somebody&#039;s trying to reduce it with just a volar plate, and it&#039;s impossible to reduce.  So I think either of those are ones that I see that are hard to fix.  If it&#039;s a couple weeks out, now there&#039;s an incision done already so it&#039;s harder to fix that.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch</b>: I think, you know, what you&#039;re alluding to is those small lunate facet fracture fragments are, as you pointed out, difficult to get over to from the FCR radial artery approach, and a lot of the plates fall short of stabilizing that small lunate piece.  And you really do need to be able to get all the way over to see that.  I think <b>Dr. Jupiter</b>&#039;s going to show that in his exposure series, that you have to be able to get all the way over to that intermediate column, see that whole piece, and then be able to stabilize that with your plate.</p><p>And as Anne alluded to, if you can&#039;t get over there from the FCR radial artery, then you need to just slide over one interval and make sure that you&#039;ve seen that because I think that&#039;s a pitfall that&#039;s very hard, I think, to recover from late.  When you see those and the wrist has fallen off of it, those are tough, I think, to recover from because the piece is relatively avascular at this point and the die is cast and those are not happy patients.  And I think that&#039;s something that, I like to see those earlier.  I like to see people recognize it a little earlier.</p><p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: The pitfalls are also screw length.</p><p>You have to be careful when you put the screws in to the plate that you don&#039;t penetrate the dorsal cortex.</p><p>It&#039;s like the roof of a house and you need to measure those, I do that with a depth gauge every time to make sure I&#039;ve got just the right screw length, and I back down just underneath that.</p><p>You want them as long as possible, but you want to be underneath that.  If they stick up above the top of the dorsal cortex, they can cause attrition of the tendons dorsally.  We saw that with plates in the top, now we&#039;re going to try to prevent that by not putting the screws through the top.</p><p>The brachioradialis style is to release that on the radial side.  It&#039;s hard to get the reduction sometimes with the tendons attached, so release the brachioradialis subperiostially in the floor of the</p><p>first dorsal compartment, release that on the radial side as we release the pronator quadratus on the radial side.  Release it with a knife, we lay that knife down right along the radius so we can gently take it distally and gently take the brachioradialis off, and it&#039;s a deforming force at the radial styloid.  Take it off, it&#039;s easier to get the fragments reduced.</p><p>That&#039;s another pitfall area or pearl that you need to do to make the reduction easier for you.  Is it articular or not?  I mean it&#039;s, traumatic arthritis probably develops from that.  We need to know if there&#039;s step off, you need to appreciate that on a good x-ray because I think that&#039;s a different animal.  I think if that changes over the next &ETH; if you have a minimally displaced fracture that could be treated closed, you&#039;ve got that articular fracture, I think you need to watch that.  If that slips off and it&#039;s three or four weeks down the road, that&#039;s a problem to deal with.</p><p>I mean I think you have to look at that closely.  If they&#039;re articular, I think you be a little more aggressive with that and maintain that joint surface where it is rather than let it slide off in three or four weeks and come back, and then it&#039;s a real problem to fix.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1311A/M1311A_3.jpg"},{category:"Tips &amp; Pearls from the Experts: Distal Radius",title:"Implant Issues",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1311A-Discussion/04_Hardware_Complications",script:"<p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: I think people have a thought that if you put this plate on it&#039;s going to reduce everything, and we still have to go to the principles of reducing the fracture.</p><p>So hardware problems where the screws are either in the joint, because you put the plate down and it looks okay, but then you fix these fixed angle screws, we don&#039;t have any adjustment, screws that are in the distal radial ulnar joint, the radial carpal joint, or too long out the back and causing tendon problems.</p><p>We&#039;re going to talk about that as a pitfall, if you look at that, the distal radius, we all know if you look at a lateral, it might look good on the lateral, but if it&#039;s, the distal radius is actually triangular so if it&#039;s off center and it look likes it just below the chondral surface, it&#039;s actually long, and then we can get a tendon problem with that.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch</b>: One thing I&#039;ve noticed between, say, 15 years ago and today is I&#039;m seeing far less complications that used to be associated with over distraction of external fixators.  I think that for quite a while, when people were not focusing on that intermediate column or not doing as you described when putting a small plate on the intermediate column, we&#039;re trying so hard to pull the intermediate column out to length with our external fixator, and as you know you&#039;re not going to be able really to do that very effectively.  And so patients were coming in with a lot of stiff fingers from that over distraction.</p><p>I&#039;m seeing that, I think, less in my practice now.  Anne, are you seeing that a little bit less?</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister</b>: There was an excellent article in the British Hand Journal about ten years ago on how you can&#039;t reduce a distal radius with an external fixator.  It was a cadaver study, but it&#039;s a very good article.  One of the reasons is distal radius is tipped down so if you use a ligamentotaxis, you can never get it down.  And the second thing is you have to, those fracture fragments are usually impacted and you&#039;re going to pull like heck and all you&#039;re going to do is stretch the ligaments.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch</b>: So you have to directly reduce those, and so I think we&#039;re seeing, I think, less of those complications.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister</b>: One thing that concerns me is the median nerve complication rate in volar plating, and that&#039;s, it&#039;s around 6 percent which is a lot.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch</b>: Yeah.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister</b>: And I really like to look at the radius like you had mentioned.  If it&#039;s an ulnar problem, go on the ulnar side, and if it&#039;s a radial, you know you&#039;re going to put a plate on, go radial to the FCR.  Radial to the FCR puts you around the midpoint of the distal radius, it let&#039;s you deal with the radial styloid issues, and that&#039;s much safer on the median nerve.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: I&#039;m seeing, I think the complications I&#039;m seeing now are harder to fix than in the old days.  Like if somebody just put it in a cast or an Ex-fix and it didn&#039;t reduce well I could fix that a little bit easier.  Now if it&#039;s plated and there&#039;s an approach where the nerve is injured and there&#039;s hardware in the joint, it&#039;s harder to fix that.  So I think that&#039;s the trend I&#039;m seeing.</p><p><b>Dr. Nossaman</b>: I think to apply the plates is technically demanding and there&#039;s a lot of detail that has to be watched at -</p><p>And especially the screw placement next to the joint surface.  And that&#039;s always been a caveat for warning for most surgeons, you have to be placed outside the joint and you need to be able to see that intraoperatively.</p><p>In my practice, I place a plate distally first and then attach to the shaft, that I think helps you get the tilt and the alignment back that you want that&#039;s anatomic instead of other alternate ways of doing it.

It illustrates, I think, some of the potential pitfalls that we see with assuming that everything can be treated with one particular device.  If you look at these plain radiographs, AP lateral and the CAT scan, John, what do you see there that would push you towards either external fixation or open reduction internal fixation?  If so, what technique do you think you would use?</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Yeah.  I think, if you look at this fracture, Dave, this is a fracture, initially, if it&#039;s seen, might not seem that bad because it&#039;s not really out of place.  It&#039;s not significantly displaced.  It&#039;s not a comminuted fracture of the articular surface, and a lot of times &#8212;</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> You mean, basically, like the radial length looks, actually, pretty good?</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Yeah.  The inclination looks good, the joint surface looks good.  My residents might look at that and say, &quot;Oh, that&#039;s not too bad.  We could push on it,&quot; but it&#039;s these little fractures that I really start to worry about because it&#039;s hard to hold them.  I think, as we were talking about earlier, that volar piece on the articular surface.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> John, you&#039;re looking at this particular piece right here on this here in the displacement; that worries you a little bit?</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Yeah.  I think a couple things about it is, it&#039;s subtle.  It&#039;s a small piece, so it&#039;s hard to grab it with a standard plate that might be a little more proximal.  Also, it&#039;s rotated.  Something&#039;s wrong.  I don&#039;t know exactly the orientation, but the articular surface is going the wrong way.  That&#039;s got to be addressed, I think, with the direct exposure and really understand where that fragment is and reduce it.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> Anne, do you have any comments when you look at those plain films?</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> Well, there&#039;s some prognostic factors for a bad outcome.  First thing, this patient looks osteopenic.  The second thing is he&#039;s got both dorsal and volar comminution and his tilt&#039;s more than ten degrees dorsal.  If this is initial displacement and it tells you have to correct that, you&#039;re going to have a bad outcome.  If they&#039;re osteopenic, they tend to settle more.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> That&#039;s right.  I totally agree.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> The good thing about it is it looks like he has a big radial styloid piece.  If they have a big radial styloid piece.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> If you look down here, you&#039;re alluding to this large fragment here, that radial column that we could stabilize in one form or fashion.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> That&#039;s the key to reducing and holding the reductions.  If we can get the radial styloid back, you can often kind of smush this.  Problem is you&#039;ve got this volar combination.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> This is one that, when I see these, I think this is a good one to consider a CAT scan because you definitely can appreciate that there&#039;s something wrong at this point.  This is really what I focus on a great deal is this intermediate column.  This intermediate column is where the lunate is going to articulate with the distal radius.  It&#039;s the one that is typically displaced when you have a die&#8211;punch type fracture, the lunate comes down and it hits this piece.  If that&#039;s not anatomically reduced, you really are probably going to have a poor outcome, as Dr. Hollister alluded to.</p><p>This is a good one, I think, where you&#039;d get a CAT scan.  If you look at the CAT scan, it&#039;s always hard to look at one particular slice of the CAT scan and come up with something.  You definitely get the feeling that there is subchondral bone here that&#039;s facing inward, into the metaphysis of the radius.  That definitely tells you that there&#039;s something that&#039;s abnormal.</p><p>Two take&#8211;home points; I think one is, if the intermediate column looks displaced and you can&#039;t quite figure out where the displacement is, I think it&#039;s a reasonable thing to get a CAT scan, and number two is, those are going to be ones that I think are going to be very difficult to treat in a closed fashion, either with external fixation or if you&#039;re going to try closed reduction and casting.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1308A/M1308A_2.jpg"},{category:"Case Discussion: Intra-articular Fracture of the Distal Radius",title:"MRI Interpretation / Treatment Options",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1308A-Discussion/M1308A_03",script:"<p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> Let&#039;s look here a little bit more closely at that.  Does that tell you anything, John, about what&#039;s going on here with this piece of bone?</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> It&#039;s hard to tell, as you said, what cut that is in the CAT scan.  Is that an axial cut, Dave, so it&#039;s an axial cut.  I think, to the right is the volar surface.   You can see that that fragment is rotated.  Also, when you&#039;re looking at the distal radial fractures, we always talk about the radial carpal surface, but you have to worry about the other articular surface, the sigmoid notch.</p><p>I think there&#039;s something going on in the sigmoid notch, part of the intermediate column that you were talking about.  It&#039;s way off.  That articular surface is way off and there&#039;s no way you can you reduce that with closed means, ligament taxis.  You&#039;re going to have to get in there.  Even when you get in there and try to reduce it, it&#039;s going to be tricky and it&#039;s a small piece.  I think you need to know your implant.  With that small piece, you&#039;re going to need some kind of implant that gets very distal that can hold that fragment.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> That&#039;s a really, I think, very important point.  If you look at how most implants are going to approach the intermediate column, if you&#039;re going to put a plate on this, they have a tendency to have a fixed angle.  If you put your plate on very distal on the volar surface of the radius, the fixed angle is going to take your screw trajectory and put it right up into the lunate.  When you look at a plate that you&#039;re going to use here, you definitely are going to be thinking about your implant and the angle that your implant takes with the articular surface.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1308A/M1308A_3.jpg"},{category:"Case Discussion: Intra-articular Fracture of the Distal Radius",title:"Intraoperative Findings",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1308A-Discussion/M1308A_04",script:"<p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b>  This is the appearance here, of the intermediate column through the volar approach.   You can see here that the articular surface is now rotated 180 degrees.  It would be &#8212; I think this is one that is tough.  Potentially, I think you could reduce it closed, but this would be one I think would be very difficult to reduce in a closed fashion.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> Sometimes, but the key part is reducing the radial styloid piece first.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Yeah.  I think Dave&#039;s point is the styloid can be reduced, but with the articular surface spun over, it&#039;d be difficult to reduce it.  I think it&#039;s very hard to reduce an articular surface that&#039;s spun 180 degrees.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> Sometimes, you can just make a small incision and push it down.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Well, that&#039;s what we&#039;re talking about &#8212; making an incision.  Exactly.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> It&#039;s a direct reduction.  I think it&#039;s a good thing to keep in mind, that when you see this telltale fragment on the lateral side, it&#039;s spun articular surface that will be hard to do purely with a closed fashion.  Now, we&#039;ll talk a little bit about what Dr. Hollister&#039;s alluding to, which would be to make a small incision on the intermediate column.  You can put just a small plate on there.  You don&#039;t need a big locking plate or anything like that to hold this, but these are tough to reduce in a purely closed manner.</p><p>I think that&#039;s an important point to kind of take home, that when you see this, you might want to get a CAT scan and you might want to think about your approach and how you&#039;re going to get there.  Interestingly, John, if you are going to approach that intermediate column with just a small plate, what surgical approach are you going to use?</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Yeah, that&#039;s a good point.  I think it&#039;s important to realize there&#039;s a couple different ways to get to the distal radius.  A lot of people are going volar plate, FCR approach.  There&#039;s a lot of discussion about it.  It&#039;s a great approach, but you have to think that&#039;s not the only way to get there.  I think, to get to this fragment it&#039;s the wrong way to get there.</p><p>If I&#039;m judging correctly, it looks like you&#039;re going ulnar approach, so there&#039;s the other way to go is between the carpal tunnel contents and the ulnar nerve vascular bundle.  Even if you have to extend it into a carpel tunnel, you can do that, but that brings you right down on that fragment.  I think that&#039;s the direct approach and the safe approach for this fragment.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> Anne, is that how you approach it?  The same way?</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> Yes</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b>   Yes.  This is one, it&#039;s, I think, also somewhat interesting.  I don&#039;t know.  We sort of passed over this as we went to the operative exposure.  This is a gentleman who had a complete ulnar nerve palsy, both motor and sensory associated with this injury.  That sort of does tell you a little bit about where that piece is sitting.  That piece is sitting right up next to the ulnar neurovascular bundle.  You&#039;re approach really is, as John alluded to, is going to be between your contents of your &#8212; of the medial side of the FCU and the ulnar neurovascular bundle and the more radial side, which would be your median nerve and your flexor tendons.  If you take the flexor tendons with them, you&#039;re probably less likely, I think, to injure the median nerve, as opposed to if you go right down on the median nerve and you&#039;re putting your retractors right on it.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> It gives a nice buffer for your retractor when you&#039;re pulling all of those tendons.  Sometimes, what you have to do is flex your wrist up to relax a little bit.  You might be struggling, and if you&#039;re extended, if you flex the wrist up and take some of the tension off, it helps.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> An interesting thing is where the distal radial ulnar joint is.  On the volar approach, says it&#039;s way over here, and that the center of the radius is actually over here.  If you&#039;re going to do that fragment on the ulnar side, you&#039;re definitely going to want to go between the ulnar nerve in the flexors because that&#039;ll drop you right in.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Yeah.  It gives you a good look at the ulnar corner.  You can put a standard plate on the radius from that approach.  It&#039;s a little harder to see the styloid, but we don&#039;t need to see the big styloid here.  We need to see this fragment.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> I look at a lot of the other joints, the radial carpel joint, the inner carpel joint and it&#039;s really striking, when you look at the comminuted dorsal fractures of the distal radiance, how much the carpus is translated dorsally.  Usually, the center point of the carpus overrides the volar cortex of the radius.  That really messes up the wrist mechanisms, so I make a big effort to try to reduce it and put it back in the correct alignment.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> Center of the radius, yep.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> Then you have to deal with that dorsal die&#8211;punch fracture.  That&#039;s hard to do with the volar plate.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> It is.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> Usually, there&#039;s more than one way to skin a cat and sometimes, you need all of them handy.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo: </b> There&#039;s several ways.</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> We&#039;re going to talk about that.  I think that&#039;s something that&#039;s a very interesting point.

These are ones where, when you put them in, you&#039;re looking at that patient in three months, and then again at six months and making absolutely sure that they&#039;re not getting some tenosynovitis associated with that because you&#039;d hate to have a rupture with that.</p><p><b>Dr. Hollister: </b> How do you manage that dorsal piece up there?</p><p><b>Dr. Ruch: </b> In this case, I think it came back together reasonably well.

I&#039;m an upper extremity hand surgeon from Tulsa, Oklahoma, and I&#039;d like to talk to you about distal radius fractures today.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1309A/M1309A_01.jpg"},{category:"Surgical Case Example: Volar Approach to an Extra-articular Distal Radius Fracture",title:"Critical Points",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1309A-Discussion/M1309A_02",script:"<p>I have some technical points that I&#039;d like to bring about that I&#039;d like to specifically talk about that are important to me, and I think will be important to you as a surgeon to help you make sure you have reproducible results in the OR.  The first one is the reduction of the volar ulnar corner.  I think it&#039;s the keystone probably of the whole thing, and once you expose the fracture, you have to see that volar ulnar corner.  It&#039;s almost always got an edge that can be comminuted.  It can be a nice contact point for the cortex to realign to regain volar tilt, angle up to the distal radius, regain radial tilt, and I think you&#039;ve got to see that.  You&#039;ve got to reduce that, and that&#039;s, for me, the first thing that I want to be able to get reduced when I perform a reduction.</p><p>Also I do a distal fragment first technique, and that may be different from what you&#039;ve seen in the past.  A lot of times we put the plate on and reduce the articular surface up to the plate, but that just seems backwards to me.  In all other areas in the body we fix the joint surface and make sure it&#039;s in good alignment and reduce that and stabilize that to the shaft, and I think you need to do the same thing in the wrist. I think anatomic reduction&#039;s what we&#039;re after here, and I don&#039;t think you can achieve that as easy by doing the plate on the shaft first and then trying to bring the fragments of the distal radius up to the plate.  I don&#039;t think you get as good reduction with that.  Plus, you get an assist of the reduction with the plate.  So, if you put the plate on the distal fragments first, then you can use the plate and reduction to help bring that alignment back to where you want to.</p><p>The radial styloid, I put two drill bits in to check the position.  I want to make sure those screws are not going into the joint.  I do that by using a drill bit, I use two guides at the same time, and I put a drill bit to the ulnar corner and a drill bit in the radial styloid, and then I check those position under fluro and I make sure they&#039;re not penetrating the joint, and that&#039;s by either having a PA view or an AP view, but also an elevated lateral.  Need to bring that up until you can see the drill bit passing just underneath the joint surface.  Then you know you&#039;re outside of the joint, and then it&#039;s safe to put the rest of the screws in.  The screws are placed anatomically.  They&#039;re supposed to have variance in their angle as they go up, and they should lie underneath the joint&#039;s surface.  But you just need to be careful, and that&#039;s the first thing I do to make sure that the screws are in safe position.</p><p>Then you reduce that up to the shaft, and you can place a compression screw through the Combi hole and bring that shaft up to the arm of the plate and then check your reduction once again with fluro, and you&#039;ll assess where your position is.  Most of the time that&#039;s all you need to do, and you can place your screws and lock it in place.  If you&#039;ve done the preoperative checks to make sure the plate&#039;s appropriate for you, you put your screws in the right place, then it&#039;s just reducing the shaft to the plate, and it really works out well each time.</p><p>Pronator coverage or the soft tissue coverage over the plate, lot of times there were &#8212; in the past, early plate designs there were some rough edges where the plates were put too far distal, the tendons seemed to rub right across the edge of that articular surface.  If you don&#039;t potentially cover that, the tendons can rub and rupture.  I&#039;ve had one in my own practice.  I&#039;ve fixed a couple others in the past that people have put in too far distal.  The tendons seem to rub across that area, and they&#039;ve ruptured.  That&#039;s a real problem.  It starts with the thumb.  It&#039;s usually an FPL rupture is the first one.  Next coming is the index finger.  They&#039;re difficult to repair, and I think it&#039;s a problem you can probably avoid if you get proper plate placement and some soft tissue coverage.</p><p>The pronator almost always is peeled off the radial side and is reflected ulnarwards subperiostially.  You release that whole muscle flap, and we&#039;ll show it here in a little bit &#8212; release that whole muscle flap, and it allows you to see the whole distal radial metaphysis.  You need to take that and place it back over the plate, it almost never goes all the way back across.  Occasionally you can get it to stretch across the fracture but very rarely.  It needs to go distal to cover the edge of the plate.  The ulnar side of that plate is what comes in contact with the tendons.  There&#039;s an MRI I&#039;ll show you here where the position of those tendons are, and it&#039;s not on the radial side and up on the radial styloid, but it&#039;s more from the midportion and ulnarward on the distal radial metaphysis.</p><p>The extended carpal radialis approach, that&#039;s what we all talk about going to the FCR tendon.  A lot of speakers have talked about in the past, and that your dividing line, how you&#039;re going down through the radius.  Almost always in my impression I can use that approach each time, even to see the volar ulnar corner.  A lot of people can&#039;t do that.  I think it&#039;s just positioning and retractors and releasing the soft tissues that allows you to do that, and I think that&#039;s what they need to strive for.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1309A/M1309A_02.jpg"},{category:"Surgical Case Example: Volar Approach to an Extra-articular Distal Radius Fracture",title:"Surgical Approach Graphic",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1309A-Discussion/M1309A_03",script:"<p>If you look at that approach, it&#039;s just going through the FCR tendon sheath, and you open the sheath and retract the FCR tendon ulnarward.  Then you develop a plane between the radial artery and the flexor tendons, and once you do that and you spread that interval apart, the pronator quadratus is sitting right on the bottom of that approach.

Sometimes if you can make that hockey stick come backwards in a Z fashion distally to gain more exposure if he needs to distally, but it&#039;s a small exposure.  I don&#039;t think it needs a big wide exposure.  I don&#039;t think you need a great, big, long plate.  The majority of these fractures can be treated with a three&#8211;hole plate.  Those big, long plates I&#039;ve not seen a need for unless the fracture extends into the shaft or extends proximally, otherwise, majority of them occur right through the metaphysis and a three&#8211;hole plate and a small incision and it&#039;s amenable for repair.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1309A/M1309A_04.jpg"},{category:"Surgical Case Example: Volar Approach to an Extra-articular Distal Radius Fracture",title:"FCR Tendon Exposure",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1309A-Discussion/M1309A_05",script:"<p>You can see that&#039;s the exposure.

But, there&#039;s a distal radius fracture, and the hand looks reasonably good.  So the first question, I think as we look through it, you have this one spot film, which we often get, and then the question is, what else do we evaluate?

Sometimes, you know, with a hand x&#8211;ray you get a reasonable wrist, but this is an inadequate wrist x&#8211;ray, so I think you need both, and I think it&#039;s a great point, wrist and hand and then also elbow and forearm.  So, there&#039;s kind of an oblique&#8211;o&#8211;gram of the distal radius.  We see a comminuted fracture, and if you look at the elbow, it looks like there&#039;s something going on.  Looks like there&#039;s a small radial head fracture.  Now, let&#039;s just talk about the distal radius.  Any further studies on the distal radius, Tom?  And I always say when I was a resident, that&#039;s all we got was, you know, plain x&#8211;rays, but anything else you would get with this comminuted fracture?</p><p><b>Dr. Higgins</b>: I may be showing age a little bit, but in fellowship we would always get a traction view of that, and the teaching was the traction view would tell you that&#039;s what &#8212; just what plain distraction&#039;s going to get you.  That&#039;s what ex fix would get you, for instance.  Ex fix is certainly out of vogue now, but there&#039;s still a lot to be said for traction view because it&#039;ll tell you a little bit more about how well the articular surface is going to behave, and then, the next question is whether or not you get a CT scan, and I think that pretty well varies by institution.  I don&#039;t know how you do it in your practice?</p><p><b>Dr. Crist</b>: I agree.  That&#039;s what I would do, too.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: I agree completely.  How do you get that traction view?  That&#039;s easy to say, and it&#039;s easy to send the resident down there to get it, but how do you do it if the patient is awake?  You know, how do you actually do it?  Is it usually if they are only sedated, or do you &#8212; you know, what&#039;s the technique you guys use for that?</p><p><b>Dr. Higgins</b>: If it&#039;s going to be reduced at all, a lot of that would be driven off the lateral.  If it&#039;s going to be reduced at all, you&#039;re going to hang them up, and when you hang them up, shoot an AP.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: Yeah, that&#039;s a good point, Thomas, but I think you need adequate sedation and, you know, to get that, and that will give you a lot of additional information.</p><p><b>Dr. Crist</b>: I think you could do &#8212; you know, if you do typically a hematoma block for your distal radius fractures, I think you could do that traction view when you&#039;re doing your reduction based on your block, too, so just a adequate analgesic, I think, is a important thing.</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: And what does that give you that a plain film doesn&#039;t give you?  What do you think, Tom?  You know, the traction view gives you &#8211;</p><p><b>Dr. Higgins</b>: I think it tells you what just external traction or external fixation&#039;s going buy you, and it&#039;ll also give you a little more detail when the carpus isn&#039;t superimposed on the wrist &#8212; I mean, on the distal radius.  If you pull the carpus out of the distal radius, it&#039;ll give you a little more data on the articular pieces of the distal radius.</p><p><b>Dr. Crist</b>: Yeah, I think it&#039;ll also show you your scaphoid better, or scapholunate joint, too, which has, you know, an associated injury pattern, so &#8211;</p><p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: Yeah, I think the overlap is what confuses us a lot.  So, if you look carefully, and you see there&#039;s a line that was drawn here, there&#039;s a little scaphoid fracture, and just as Brett was saying, there&#039;s &amp;#8212; you know, carpal injuries you don&#039;t want to miss, so it appears like there&#039;s like a midwaist scaphoid fracture as well as this comminuted distal radius fracture.  And we get &#8212; I would get a CAT scan of this.</p><p>And I would get it after we have some kind of reduction, because I think it helps.  It&#039;s kind of like in a pilon.  You want to do it after an ex fix, but even after reduction and splinting, and I think it&#039;s important to think about what you&#039;re going to do with this fracture.  Clearly you&#039;re going to operate on this, so if I splinted this, I probably put it &#8212; wouldn&#039;t put it in a sugar tong just because it might make it harder to get it into the CAT scan gantry, so I would maybe put it on &#8212; in a volar splint or a volar dorsal slab, because a lot of times a radiologist says, &quot;Well, I can&#039;t get the hand in there,&quot; so I want to give him every opportunity to get a good CAT scan and also to &#8212; you know, if it&#039;s going to &#8212; the patient&#039;s going to wait a day or so to be able to elevate the arm easily.</p><p>So, but I think a CAT scan is helpful, and it&#039;s interesting, you know, I&#039;ll date myself, but when I was a resident, we never got CAT scans of radii because &#8212; I don&#039;t know, we just didn&#039;t think about it.  And then, now it makes sense, and I think it can dictate your approach a little bit.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1328A/M1328A_05.jpg"},{category:"Case Discussion: C-Type Distal Radius Fracture with Associated Injuries",title:"Assessing the Treatment",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1328A-Discussion/M1328A_06",script:"<p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: So, now we have a comminuted distal radius, a scaphoid &#8212; a midwaist scaphoid fracture, we&#039;ll say nondisplaced, and a radial head fracture.

And then, the radial head, it looks like there&#039;s comminution there in probably &#8212; more than 30 percent of the joint.  It&#039;s a little bit hard to tell on the lateral, for sure, and I didn&#039;t see that we had an AP, but if &#8212; definitely if it&#039;s comminuted, I would fix it.  I would base that on, you know, a second view as well.

You could maybe, you know, do a little flexion, a little ulnar deviation but not too much, because we know if you flex your wrist down, your fingers can&#039;t flex, and then you have trouble with rehab.  And if you have stiff fingers, that&#039;s a big problem.</p>",thumbnail:videoPosterPathPrefix+"M1328A/M1328A_10.jpg"},{category:"Case Discussion: C-Type Distal Radius Fracture with Associated Injuries",title:"Tourniquet Issues",href:videoPathPrefix+"M1328A-Discussion/M1328A_11",script:"<p><b>Dr. Capo</b>: So how &#8212; and I think, you know, tourniquet management is an issue, and sometimes we can do cases without a tourniquet, but you have to think about, you know, how do you stage these, because you know, think about stability and also timing.
